Our students succeed when parents and school work hand in hand. It is through dedicated partnership with parents that we can create a place where our students can achieve their potential and lead a fulfilling life. We are blessed in VJC to have a wonderfully supportive Parent Support Group who work closely with the school to provide a holistic nurturing environment for our students. Join us on this meaningful journey now!
