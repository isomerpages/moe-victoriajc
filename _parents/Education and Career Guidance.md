Is your child clear about his/her interests, abilities and passion? Is he/she about to make an important decision regarding his/her education and career pathways?

We recognise that for our children to thrive in a globalised economy and navigate meaningfully through life, they would benefit from having sound values and learning to seize every opportunity to develop transferable soft skills such as cross-cultural communication skills, problem-solving skills, and team work; and continually developing workplace readiness skills such as literacy, numeracy, and technical skills throughout life. 

### How parents can help

You can help guide your child to make informed education and career choices that will impact his or her future.

* Show support for your child, by having conversations and being open-minded.
* Observe your child’s strengths and interests.
* Listen to your child and find out which courses or occupations interest him or her.
* Encourage your child to participate in the college’s ECG activities to learn more about a variety of occupations.
* Support your child’s aspirations.

Your child can also have further conversations with his or her civics tutor and the school ECG Counsellor.

### What is Education and Career Guidance (ECG)?

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives.

The ECG curriculum aims to:

*   Nurture students’ self-awareness and self-directedness and lifelong learning;
*   Enable students to explore education and career options, by equipping them with accurate and comprehensive information;
*   Help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities, and appreciate all occupations across society; and
*   Create opportunities for students to build positive connections with the community, to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.
