<h3>Watching for Signs of Distress in Children</h3>
<p>When our children are going through distress, they send out warning signs
through their behaviour, but do we know what to watch for? Are we catching
the signals for help being sent out?</p>
<p>Being familiar with these distress signs will help us identify problems
early. If these signs are present in combination, or in more extreme or
long-lasting forms, it may be an indication that your child is experiencing
significant distress. If in doubt, please seek help and advice from your
child's School Counsellor or mental health professionals. If you suspect
your child is at risk of suicide, get help immediately from SOS 1800 221
4444.</p>
