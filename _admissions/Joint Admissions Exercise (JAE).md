### Joint Admissions Exercise


The Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) to junior colleges is conducted by the Ministry of Education. Secondary 4 students will receive an instruction booklet from their secondary schools, with detailed instructions on how to apply. They can apply through the internet or personally at any junior college during the stipulated registration period.

The Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) is scheduled to be conducted in January each year.

    <label for="accordion4">4. Must I take Mother Tongue at VJC?</label>

    <div>

      <p>Students who did not take Higher Mother Tongue at O-Levels must take H1 MTL.</p>

<p>Students who have obtained at least D7 in the O-Level Higher Mother Tongue examination would have met the minimum requirement for University Admission.</p>

<p>However, students who wish to improve their MTL grade can continue to take Higher 1 MTL and sit for the exam at the end of JC1.</p>

<p>The H1 MTL grade will be included in the computation of UAS for admission to local universities and for admission to MTL-related courses if the applicant has done well in it. Please refer to the university websites for more information.</p>

    <label for="accordion6">6. Is CCA compulsory in JC?</label>

    <div>

      <p>CCAs are not compulsory. However, we urge students to take up at least one CCA so that they can have a balance of academic and non-academic activities. CCAs are a great platform to pursue your talent and interests, take on new challenges, and foster strong relationships with peers.</p>

    <label for="accordion7">7. I am not an IP student.Is there any disadvantage if I join VJC from the JAE?</label>

    <div>

      <p>There is no disadvantage to being a JAE student in VJC. In fact, JAE students form the majority in VJC (more than 60%). JC1 students (IP & JAE) will choose their subject combinations and start their academic lessons only <u>after</u> the JAE students report. There is no separation of classes either - Victorians are put in mixed classes regardless of background. All Victorians have equal opportunity for leadership and equal access to our wide range of programmes and awards.</p>
