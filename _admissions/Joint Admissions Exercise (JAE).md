**4. Must I take Mother Tongue at VJC?**

<p>Students who did not take Higher Mother Tongue at O-Levels must take H1 MTL.</p>

<p>Students who have obtained at least D7 in the O-Level Higher Mother Tongue examination would have met the minimum requirement for University Admission.</p>

<p>However, students who wish to improve their MTL grade can continue to take Higher 1 MTL and sit for the exam at the end of JC1.</p>

<p>The H1 MTL grade will be included in the computation of UAS for admission to local universities and for admission to MTL-related courses if the applicant has done well in it. Please refer to the university websites for more information.</p>

**5. Where can I get more information about the subjects examined at GCE A-Level?**

Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) provides comprehensive information on the subjects which are examined at GCE A-Levels. You may find out more from their website at

**6. Is CCA compulsory in JC?**

CCAs are not compulsory. However, we urge students to take up at least one CCA so that they can have a balance of academic and non-academic activities. CCAs are a great platform to pursue your talent and interests, take on new challenges, and foster strong relationships with peers.<p></p>

**7. I am not an IP student.Is there any disadvantage if I join VJC from the JAE?**

There is no disadvantage to being a JAE student in VJC. In fact, JAE students form the majority in VJC (more than 60%). JC1 students (IP &amp; JAE) will choose their subject combinations and start their academic lessons only&nbsp;<u>after</u>&nbsp;the JAE students report.&nbsp;There is no separation of classes either - Victorians are put in mixed classes regardless of background. All Victorians have equal opportunity for leadership and equal access to our wide range of programmes and awards.
