<summary><strong>Must I take Mother Tongue at VJC?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Students who did not take Higher Mother Tongue at O-Levels must take H1
MTL.</p>
<p>Students who have obtained at least D7 in the O-Level Higher Mother Tongue

take Higher 1 MTL and sit for the exam at the end of JC1.</p>
<p>The H1 MTL grade will be included in the computation of UAS for admission

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) provides comprehensive
information on the subjects which are examined at GCE A-Levels. You may
find out more from their website at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level</a>

<summary><strong>Is CCA compulsory in JC?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>CCAs are not compulsory. However, we urge students to take up at least
one CCA so that they can have a balance of academic and non-academic activities.
CCAs are a great platform to pursue your talent and interests, take on
new challenges, and foster strong relationships with peers.</p>

<summary><strong>I am not an IP student.Is there any disadvantage if I join VJC from the JAE?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There is no disadvantage to being a JAE student in VJC. In fact, JAE students
form the majority in VJC (more than 60%). JC1 students (IP &amp; JAE) will
choose their subject combinations and start their academic lessons only&nbsp;<u>after</u>&nbsp;the
JAE students report.&nbsp;There is no separation of classes either - Victorians
are put in mixed classes regardless of background. All Victorians have
equal opportunity for leadership and equal access to our wide range of
programmes and awards.</p>
