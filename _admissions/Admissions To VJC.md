VJC offers a 2-year programme leading to the GCE A-Level examinations. The programme is open to students who have just completed their GCE O-Level examinations or Secondary 4 equivalent.

Our students come from more than 50 secondary schools all over the island. In fact, more than 60% of our intake comes from the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE), ensuring a rich cultural and social diversity.
