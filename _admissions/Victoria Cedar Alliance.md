VJC’s educational journey to academic excellence took a historic turn in 2011 with the announcement of the Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP). Students who are part of this programme will spend their first four years either in Victoria School or Cedar Girls’ Secondary School, and the final two years in VJC. At the end of the six-year programme, VCA IP students sit for the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level Examination administered by the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).

The Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme seeks to develop students into social innovators  who challenge processes and produce innovative solutions for a better community, and passionate learners who seek and create new knowledge.  This is a programme that stretches students’ potential, demands their full participation and develops their personal voice and identity. Since its launch in 2012, the VCA IP has drawn on the outstanding academic track records of Victoria School and Cedar Girls’ Secondary School, as well as the experience and vibrancy of Victoria Junior College, to develop young men and women equipped and excited to serve society.

We warmly welcome you to embark on this exciting 6-year journey with us. Click [here](https://go.gov.sg/vcaipehandbook) to view the VCA IP Handbook and find out more about the people and programmes that make the Victoria-Cedar experience one to remember for a lifetime.
