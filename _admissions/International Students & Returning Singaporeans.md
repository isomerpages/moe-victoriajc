### International Students

International students seeking admission are to apply directly to the college from October to December. Interested students should send in their cover letter and relevant education certificates to [**victoria_jc@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:victoria_jc@moe.edu.sg)

Students are strongly encouraged to submit [**JPACT**](http://pact.sg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=95) results for the college's consideration. If found suitable, the student will undergo an interview process and may be required to take school-based placement tests.

Admission is not guaranteed, and is subject to the international students meeting the college’s admission criteria and availability of vacancies.

More information can be found on the [**MOE Admissions**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions) website.

### Returning Singaporeans

Returning Singaporeans who have done the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS-JC/MI) test and have Victoria Junior College on their results list may approach us for admission application.

**About SPERS-JC/MI**  

Returning Singaporeans are advised to participate in the SPERS-JC/MI which is a centralised placement exercise conducted in November each year for Returning Singaporeans who wish to join the Pre-University 1 level at the beginning of the next academic year.

As admission to JC/MI is merit-based, Returning Singaporeans who wish to participate in SPERS-JC/MI will be required to sit for SPERS-JC/MI tests comprising English, Mathematics and General Ability tests. Based on their performance in the SPERS-JC/MI tests, successful applicants will be provided with a list of JC/MI where students with similar abilities are already studying. Applicants may then approach any of the JC/MI on their lists to apply for admission.

Please visit MOE website ([https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans/post-secondary/spers](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans/post-secondary/spers)) to find out more.
