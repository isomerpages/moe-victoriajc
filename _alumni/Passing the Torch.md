“Nothing without labour”

We would not have the Victoria we know today without the labour of our predecessors. When you make a gift to Victoria, know that you will in turn, make a difference, and keep our flag unfurled.

To make an online donation to VJC via credit cards or NETS, please click on this link which will take you to our donation page on [Giving.SG Portal](https://www.giving.sg/organisation/profile/72b74417-df7c-4496-b8ed-b46878b5775a).

We are grateful for the immense support we receive from our alumni, parents, and well-wishers. Your donation enables VJC to provide programmes and facilities beyond the standard provision of a government school and to help deserving students in need of financial assistance.

We thank you for your continual support and partnership in delivering holistic education to all Victorians.
