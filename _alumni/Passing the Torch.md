“Nothing without labour”

We would not have the Victoria we know today without the labour of our predecessors. When you make a gift to Victoria, know that you will in turn, make a difference, and keep our flag unfurled.

We are grateful for the immense support we receive from our alumni, parents, and well-wishers. Your donation enables VJC to provide programmes and facilities beyond the standard provision of a government school and to help deserving students in need of financial assistance.

We thank you for your continual support and partnership in delivering holistic education to all Victorians.
