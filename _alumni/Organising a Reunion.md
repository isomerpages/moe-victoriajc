Dear alumni, grab your friends, classmates, CCA mates and come back to VJC for a reunion! Meet up with old friends and exchange stories as you walk through the familiar corridors.

The College is happy to provide an avenue of support. We would be happy to source for suitable venues within the school compound, extend an invitation on your behalf to teachers currently in our employ or who have left the College and help publicize the reunion on our media pages (instagram, facebook and school website).

For further assistance in organising a reunion , do not hesitate toÂ [contact us](mailto:victoria_jc@moe.edu.sg).
