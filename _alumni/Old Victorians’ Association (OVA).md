The Old Victorians’ Association (OVA) was established in 1941 as a formal channel for alumni to continue to associate with their alma mater after having left the school or the college. These include Victoria Afternoon School, Victoria Bridge School, Victoria Pre-University, Victoria School and Victoria Junior College.

The  OVA endeavours to keep alumni in close touch with the achievements of their alma mater, as well as to provide opportunities for OVA members to maintain and renew ties with past teachers and fellow Victorians.

To this end, the OVA organises and promotes numerous sports, social and cultural activities for participation by its members. Activities organised by the association are usually held in either VS, VJC or held externally.

The OVA also provides support for various activities undertaken by the Victorian academic institutions, including providing assistance to economically disadvantaged and deserving Victorians.

The office of the OVA is situated in Victoria School, a courtesy extended by the school to the association in 2003 when the former moved into its current Siglap premises.
