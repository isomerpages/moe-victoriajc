<h4><strong>Odyssey</strong></h4>
<p>The highly anticipated JC1 Orientation 2024 was held in early February
where over 5 days, Orientation Group Leaders initiated freshies to the
odyssey of Victorian life. As the JC1s played games and learned the mass
dances and school cheers together, they made core memories and forged meaningful
friendships to last a lifetime. Orientation ended with a bang at Suntec
City’s Fountain of Wealth, where Victorians cheered and danced to their
hearts’ content and came together to display our Victorian spirit!</p>
