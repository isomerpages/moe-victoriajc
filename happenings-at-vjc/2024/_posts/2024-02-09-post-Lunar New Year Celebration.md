<p>Shouts of ‘Huat-ah!’ filled the air as VJC welcomed the Year of the Dragon
with the traditional Lo-Hei for all students and staff. At the Lunar New
Year concert, Mr Low brought much good cheer as the God of Fortune and
spirits were kept high with spectacular performances by the Chinese Orchestra,
Chinese Society, Malay Cultural Society and Wushu team. The concert ended
on a high note with the Dragon Parade where the various Houses showcased
their creative interpretations of the dragon and brought much excitement
and mirth to the audience!</p>
