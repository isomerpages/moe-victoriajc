<p>Victorians ended semester 1 on a high note with Feeling 4-midable! From
thrilling activities like archery tag, to a picnic and a ‘silent’ movie
experience under the stars, Victorians had a well-deserved break to cap
the end of a busy semester!</p>
<p>Our Parent Support Group (PSG) also took the opportunity to break a national
record! VJC is proud to have created the longest word formation made of
balloons, at a record of 25.0m! Way to go PSG!</p>
