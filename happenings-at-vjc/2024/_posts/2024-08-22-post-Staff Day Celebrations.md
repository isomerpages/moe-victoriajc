<p>Staff Day celebrations kicked off with a scrumptious lunch treat for VJC
staff on 20<sup>th</sup> August, lovingly prepared by the Parents’ Support
Group to thank the staff for their hard work throughout the year. &nbsp;🫶</p>
<p>&nbsp;The college also came together to celebrate the dedication and commitment
of our teachers and staff on 22<sup>nd</sup> August. Students put up exhilarating
performances and meaningful activities to honour their teachers for their
hard and heart work to transform the mundane into extraordinary learning
experiences everyday. Happy Teachers’ Day! ❤️</p>
