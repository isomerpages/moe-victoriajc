<p>A group of brave and generous Victorians came forward to support Hair
for Hope’s satellite event ‘<em>Hope is yours to Give</em>’ at VJC by getting
their hair shaved to raise awareness of childhood cancer. Volunteer shavees
also showed their collective commitment to support children with cancer
and their families by raising funds for the Children’s Cancer Foundation.
