<p>As part of the 38<sup>th</sup> Annual Study-cum-Immersion Programme, Victorians
hosted Taiwanese students for a week, organising a whirlwind of activities
from CCA sharing sessions to special lessons to allow them to get to know
Singapore more intimately. Our teachers also shared more about VJCâ€™s unique
programmes, such as Theatre Studies and Drama, with the Taiwanese educators.</p>
