<p>Victorians came together to celebrate the various achievements of our
Victorians during our 40<sup>th</sup> College Day. From the Victorians who
showed grit and resolve as they overcame challenges in their commitment
to excellence in different spheres, to those who led in various ways to
serve the community, our Victorians have exemplified our motto, ‘<em>Nil Sine Labore</em>’,
as they have worked hard for their achievements. Our Special Guest, Ms
Nadia Ahmad Samdin, from the class of 2007, exhorted the awardees to continue
excelling in different areas and using their talents to serve the wider
community.</p>
<p>A heartfelt congratulations to all prize-winners and award recipients
for their accomplishments!</p>
