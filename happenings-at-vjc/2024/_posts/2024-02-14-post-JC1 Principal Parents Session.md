<p>JC1 parents attended the JC1 Principal-Parents Session to get acquainted
with the JC system and the various programmes in VJC designed for the holistic
development of Victorians. At the event, parents heard from our student
leaders and the Parent Support Group (PSG) on how to better support their
children through JC life. This was followed by a panel discussion where
the panellists comprising school leaders, key personnel, the PSG and a
JC2 student addressed questions posted by parents on the academic and non-academic
programme.</p>
