<p>A staple in the VJC calendar, the EdVantage! Fair is organised by the
VJC Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) and Talent Development Committees
to expose students to a wide range of further studies and career options.
This yearâ€™s edition saw over 50 universities and partner organisations
converging in our campus, with industry speakers sharing more about the
career opportunities in their respective fields. Fun fact: each industry
speaker who came back that day was a Victorian alumnus!</p>
