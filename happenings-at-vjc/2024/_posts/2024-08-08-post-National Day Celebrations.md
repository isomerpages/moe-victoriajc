<p>VJC celebrated the nationâ€™s 59<sup>th</sup> birthday by gathering at our
Parade Square for the National Day Observance Ceremony. Victorians stood
at attention as representatives from different uniformed groups marched
in, proudly bearing the State Flag and Colours flags to the drum beat of
the Symphonic Band. After the ceremony, Victorians had fun taking part
in various sports, arts and heritage activities, and gathered for the finale
concert where everyone sang along to their favourite National Day songs!
