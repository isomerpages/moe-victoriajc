<p>The last day of school for our J2 students was a delightful mix of fun
and heartfelt memories as they reminisced about their journey and celebrated
their growth in VJC over the last two years. This was capped with a farewell
assembly with exhilarating performances, and of course, the much-loved
mass dance! 🎸👯</p>
<p>We will miss our J2s but we are proud to see how they have grown and overcome
all the challenges that came their way, while staying true to the Victorian
vision of being Something More! ❤️</p>
