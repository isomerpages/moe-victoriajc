<p>Victorians had the opportunity to learn more about our rich cultural heritage
through an array of activities organised by the Chinese Society, Malay
Cultural Society, Indian Cultural Society and Art Club for the Mother Tongue
Fortnight Fiesta. From batik painting to having a taste of traditional
foods and herbs, Victorians had fun while developing a deeper appreciation
of different cultural practices.</p>
