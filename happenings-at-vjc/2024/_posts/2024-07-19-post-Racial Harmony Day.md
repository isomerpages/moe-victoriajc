<p>VJC celebrated Racial Harmony Day on 19 July with a showcase organised
by our cultural societies to help Victorians understand the intricacies
and significance of various ethnic communitiesâ€™ wedding rituals. Students
also got to sample the cuisine of different racial groups and engage in
traditional games!</p>
