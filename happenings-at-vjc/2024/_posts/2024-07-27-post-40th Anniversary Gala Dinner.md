<p>VJC celebrated our 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary with a bang on 27 July!
From the pioneer batch to the recently graduated J3s, former Victorian
staff and students reconnected for a heartwarming night of shared memories
and laughter. The celebration was made even more special by the presence
of our Guest of Honour, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Lawrence
Wong, alumnus of the class of 1989. Hereâ€™s to many more years of Victorian
spirit and achievements!</p>
