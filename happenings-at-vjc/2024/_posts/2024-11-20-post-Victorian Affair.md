<p>What better way to celebrate the end of the JC1 academic year than to
spend the morning at the beach 🌞🤸and the evening at a party? 🪩🕺</p>
<p>For this year’s edition of Outdoor Affair, J1s enjoyed the sun, sand and
sea at Sentosa while playing games to build bonds and memories to treasure
forever! 😎</p>

<p>In the evening, Victorians had a good time letting down their hair in
the Lasting Affair, our annual rooftop concert at Vivocity for J1s! 🥳
Performers included talented members of our alumni and current JC1 students
and with this, Victorians brought the year to an epic close! 💥</p>
