<p>Victorians commemorated Total Defence Day together with the rest of the
nation on 15 Feb 2024. Students heard from VJC alumnus, Brigadier-General
Tan Tiong Keat, who invited them to reflect on their Total Defence story
in the face of the global geopolitical tensions of recent times. VJC also
participated in the nation-wide Exercise SG Ready simulation of an attack
on Singapore by going through a power disruption in the morning. Some teachers
got creative and held their lessons at various locations on the school
campus, demonstrating how oneâ€™s mindset to make the best of a situation
matters in times of disruption!</p>
