<p>VJC’s Open House saw prospective students and parents thronging our campus
to experience the Victorian spirit and learn more about what we have to
offer. The theme of ‘V Got Your Back!’ was evident as the whole school
pitched in to make the Open House an enriching activity for all guests.
The school was abuzz with activity as guests enjoyed performances and activities
organised by various CCAs and found out more about the instructional programme
at the subject booths.</p>
