<p>The SG Dialogue for JC1 students was held with Mr Lawrence Anderson, Senior
Fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at NTU and former
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Ambassador, on 14 October. Mr Anderson
gave insights into the core principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and
shared his perspectives about global developments. Our students kept the
dialogue lively by asking questions about his ambassadorial experience
and how MFA smoothly manages Singapore’s relations on the bilateral, regional
and international levels.</p>
