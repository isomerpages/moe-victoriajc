After a hectic but happy Term 1, Victorians came out to play on Games Day! The PE Department and Studentsâ€™ Council organised a series of activities, including an Outdoor Rumble, Indoor Games and House Meetings, to create opportunities for Victorians to have fun and bond with their peers. Vintage Victorian camaraderie was on full display during telematches, sports friendlies, station games and house pow-wows. Onward to Term 2!
