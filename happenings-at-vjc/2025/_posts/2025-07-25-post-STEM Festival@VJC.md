<p>As part of the STEM Festival, VJC hosted three different science outreach
events â€“ the DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotics Challenge, the A*STAR-VJC Science Fair,
and the 2025 Amazing Eco-STEM Race. This year, an overwhelming number of
research project entries from more than 30 schools featured in the Science
Fair, and the STEM Festival saw more than 400 participants from primary
and secondary schools in total.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone who took part!</p>
