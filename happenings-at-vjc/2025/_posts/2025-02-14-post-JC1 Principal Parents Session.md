<p>The annual JC1 Principal-Parents Session at VJC welcomed parents of JC1
students, providing them with valuable insights into the Junior College
system and the wide range of programmes designed to support the holistic
development of Victorians. During the session, JC2 students and the JC1
Year Head shared guidance on how parents can best support their children
through JC life. A panel discussion followed, where school leaders and
key personnel addressed parents' questions on both academic and non-academic
programmes, fostering a deeper understanding of the VJC experience.</p>
