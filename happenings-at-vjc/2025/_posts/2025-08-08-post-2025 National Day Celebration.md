<p>To celebrate SG60, the Victorian and Cedarian family came together for
a combined National Day celebration at VJC, creating the formation ‘VJC
❤️SG’ on the school field. During the National Day Observance Ceremony,
representatives from different uniformed groups marched in, proudly bearing
the State Flag and Colours flags to the drum beat of the Symphonic Band.&nbsp;This
was followed by various performances and the finale where everyone sang
along to their favourite National Day songs!</p>
