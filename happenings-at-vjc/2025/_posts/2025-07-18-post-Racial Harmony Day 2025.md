<p>The theme for Racial Harmony Day this year, Our People – Our Tapestry,
invites students to recognise and appreciate the vibrant and interconnected
nature of our multicultural society. During civics lessons, students reflected
on how everyday interactions can nurture empathy and strengthen cross-cultural
understanding. The celebrations also came alive as students experienced
the richness of our heritage firsthand through trying their hand at traditional
games and sampling delicious treats from Singapore’s diverse cultural communities.</p>
