<p>VJC slithered into the Year of the Snake with a sizzling start! The festivities
kicked off with a lively Lo-Hei, where students and staff tossed their
way to luck and prosperity. The concert was a spectacular showcase of energy,
featuring electrifying performances by the Chinese Orchestra, Malay Cultural
Society, Indian Cultural Society, and Wushu. Huat-ah!</p>
