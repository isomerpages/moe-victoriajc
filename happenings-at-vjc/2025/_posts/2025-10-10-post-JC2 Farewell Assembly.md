<p>The final day of school for our J2s was a wonderful blend of laughter
and nostalgia, as they looked back on how far they have come and celebrated
everything they have achieved in VJC over the past two years. This year’s
JC2 Farewell Assembly was extra special, with parents joining us to witness
their children’s graduation and sharing in the celebrations that marked
the end of their Victorian journey.</p>
<p>We are going to miss our J2s, but we are also proud of how they have grown
and tackled every challenge head-on, all while staying true to the Victorian
spirit of striving to be Something More!</p>
