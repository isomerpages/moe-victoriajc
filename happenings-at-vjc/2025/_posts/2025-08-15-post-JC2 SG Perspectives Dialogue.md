<p>Our JC2 students engaged in a meaningful <em>SG Perspectives Dialogue</em> with
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade &amp; Industry, Ms Gan
Siow Huang, where they exchanged ideas on how they could help build a stronger,
fairer, and more united Singapore. Coming on the heels of the nation’s
SG60 celebrations, the dialogue was a timely platform for Victorians to
voice their hopes and aspirations, as well as reflect on the challenges
that shape Singapore’s future.</p>
