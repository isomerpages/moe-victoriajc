<p>Victorians commemorated Total Defence Day together with the rest of the
nation by participating in the Total Defence Food Resilience Preparedness
Programme, part of Exercise SG Ready. Students consumed Ready-To-Eat meals
at ambient temperatures to simulate a food disruption scenario where no
gas or electricity provision is available for the reheating of meals. Students
were also briefed on the importance of food resilience and the relevance
of Ready-To-Eat meals.</p>
