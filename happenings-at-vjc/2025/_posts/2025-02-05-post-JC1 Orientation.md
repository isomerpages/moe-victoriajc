<p>The JC1 Orientation burned bright with <em>Incandescence</em>, lighting
up VJC with five days of non-stop energy and excitement! Our fiery Orientation
Group Leaders ignited the spark of Victorian life, welcoming freshies through
epic games, mass dances, and school cheers that echoed across campus. Laughter
and friendships blazed to life, turning moments into unforgettable core
memories. The grand finale was a dazzling display of Victorian spirit,
where cheers roared, feet stomped, and hearts burned with pride. From start
to finish, Orientation was a radiant celebrationâ€”because at VJC, our spirit
shines brighter than ever!</p>
