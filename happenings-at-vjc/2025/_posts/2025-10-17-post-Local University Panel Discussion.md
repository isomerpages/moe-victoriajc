<p>VJC welcomed our JC1 students and their parents for a session aimed at
giving them a clearer understanding of university admissions and the latest
developments in the higher education scene. Representatives from all six
local autonomous universities joined a panel discussion, and there were
booths set up in the concourse so students and parents could have more
personalised conversations with them. During the Q&amp;A segment in the
Performance Theatre, many relevant questions were raised, and the panelists’
responses provided helpful context to support our students in their Educational
and Career Guidance (ECG) journey.</p>
