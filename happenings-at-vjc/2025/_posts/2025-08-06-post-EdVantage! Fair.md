<p>A highlight of the VJC calendar, the <em>EdVantage! Fair</em> is organised
by the Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) and Talent Development Committees
to broaden studentsâ€™ horizons on future study and career pathways. With
booths by partner organisations from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs),
Ministries, and Statutory Boards, as well as insightful ECG talks delivered
by Victorian alumni and IHL partners, Victorians had the opportunity to
actively explore and chart their next steps with confidence.</p>
