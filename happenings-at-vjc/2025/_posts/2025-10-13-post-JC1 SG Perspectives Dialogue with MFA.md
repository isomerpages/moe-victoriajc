<p>The SG Perspectives Dialogue for our JC1 students took place on 13 October
with Mr Heng Aik Yeow, Director-General of Southeast Asia I Directorate,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Mr Heng shared his thoughts on the key
principles behind Singapore’s foreign policy and offered his take on current
global events. Our students kept things engaging with their questions about
how MFA skillfully handles Singapore’s relationships at different levels.
And a fun fact to top it off: Mr Heng is a VJC alumnus!</p>
