<p>The celebrations continued on the last day of term 3 as the college community
came together to honour the passion and commitment of our teachers and
staff. Students lit up the stage with vibrant performances, expressing
gratitude for the way their teachers turn everyday lessons into extraordinary
learning experiences. Wishing all our teachers a very Happy Teachers’ Day!</p>
