<p>The VJC Open House was a whirlwind of energy, excitement, and pure Victorian
spirit! With the theme <em>“V Got Your Back!”</em> in full swing, the campus
was buzzing as future Victorians and their families explored all that we
have to offer. From electrifying performances to hands-on activities by
our CCAs, there was never a dull moment. Subject booths were packed with
curious minds eager to dive into our academic programs, while friendly
students and teachers made sure every guest felt right at home. It was
a day of discovery, fun, and community – because at VJC, we’ve truly got
your back!</p>
