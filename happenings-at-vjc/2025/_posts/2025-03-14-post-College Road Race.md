<p>East Coast Park transformed into a vibrant sea of yellow as Victorians
wrapped up Term 1 with the College Road Race! With determination and plenty
of spirit, they powered through the 4km run, celebrating the end of a hectic
term with fun, laughter, and camaraderie. What a way to finish strong â€“
bring on Term 2!</p>
