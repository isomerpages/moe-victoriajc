<p>Victorians came together with pride and joy to celebrate the accomplishments
of our students and staff at the 41<sup>st</sup> College Day. Guided by
the theme <em>Living the Victorian Spirit</em>, the occasion highlighted
how Victorians continue to pursue excellence with integrity, resilience,
and compassion, lifting others as they rise. Our Guest of Honour, Ms Gan
Siow Huang, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade &amp; Industry,
challenged the awardees to embrace change with curiosity and confidence
in the face of global challenges.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our award recipients and prize-winners for exemplifying
the Victorian Spirit!</p>
