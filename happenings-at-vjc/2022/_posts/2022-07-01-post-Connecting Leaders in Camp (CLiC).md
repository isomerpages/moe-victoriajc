From 1-3 Jul, CCA leaders participated in CLiC. This was an integral part of their journey to strengthen their personal identities, shape their perspectives on leadership and acquire the skills to become confident student leaders. They were guided by their seniors and teachers, who were dedicated to nurturing the next generation of trailblazers in our Victorian community.
