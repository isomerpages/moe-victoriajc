The Humanities Scholars’ Programme (HSP) Symposium was held in the last week of Term 2 and saw the participation of over a hundred secondary school students! Our JC2 HSP Scholars researched and presented on the theme of “The Future of Cities”. From considering the history and development of cities, to the presentation of cities in various texts, our Victorians’ sharing certainly illustrated the concept of cities as seen through various lens of the humanities. In addition, participants were engaged in a variety of activities such as Make-Your-Own-Story adventure game and hands-on activities such Build Your Own City.
