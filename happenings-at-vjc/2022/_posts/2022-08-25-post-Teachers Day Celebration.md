Victorians came together to celebrate the hard and heart work of our teachers and staff as Term 3 came to a close. On 25 Aug, students organised activities and prepared loving tributes for their teachers to thank them for giving their very best. That afternoon, staff let their hair down and bonded over good food and much laughter. The ever-thoughtful Parentsâ€™ Support Group also prepared a sumptuous lunch treat on 31 Aug, to thank staff for their dedication.
