The VJC Science & Technology Centre was established to be an incubator for scientific talent and aims to nurture students who aspire to be future scientists and technopreneurs. In line with that objective, the VJC S&T Centre organised the A\*STAR-VJC Science Fair and DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotics Challenge on 29 Jul. With 350 students from 30 schools participating, the college was abuzz with excitement as students were eager to share their passion for STEM.
