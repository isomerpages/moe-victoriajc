On 13 & 14 Jan 2022, we showcased the vibrancy of our college life through our e-Open House. While the ongoing pandemic meant that we still could not welcome prospective students and parents to visit our campus in-person, that did not dampen our spirits or cramp our style! Various student bodies such as the Students’ Council, Robotics-Makers Club, Studio V, Photography Society and FACEs (student ambassadors) pulled out all stops to curate a vivid virtual experience for all who visited our e-Open House microsite and attended our webinars. Outdoor Activities Club also helped to transform the façade of our campus, putting up a stunning light display for those who strolled or drove along Marine Parade Road at night!
