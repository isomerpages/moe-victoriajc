On 16 Feb 2022, over 400 parents of our JC1 students attended a webinar to better understand the academic and co-curricular programmes of VJC. Our Principal, Mr Jeffrey Low, shared the college’s vision, mission and values, before handing the time over to key personnel to elaborate on key programmes and address parents’ queries and concerns. VJC values our partnership with parents and hopes to collaborate closely with them to make Victoria truly something more!
