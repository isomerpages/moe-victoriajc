VJC welcomed our newest members on 7 Feb 2022! Led by enthusiastic Orientation Group Leaders, the JC1s learnt more about our academic and co-curricular programmes, bonded through games and play quests, learnt the moves of our signature mass dances (a rite of passage for any Victorian) and soaked in the atmosphere on finale night! Once again, our campus was lit up with glittering fairy lights, which symbolised the start of a magical journey!
