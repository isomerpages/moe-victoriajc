In this ‘By Victorians, For Victorians’ edition of JC2 Feeling Fab, our student leaders facilitated their peers in various engaging activities. JC2 Victorians spent their Feeling Fab morning making terrariums, crocheting coasters, watercolor painting, moulding clay figurines and designing their own tote bags. At the end of the term, JC1 Victorians embarked on their own Feeling Fab, in campus and beyond! The classes picked from a variety of activities, such as frisbee, fencing, dragon boating and ice cream making! A definite treat on the last Fri-YAY of the term.
