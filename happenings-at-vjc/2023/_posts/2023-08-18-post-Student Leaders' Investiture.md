On 18 August, VJC had its first combined Student Leaders’ Investiture, with Students' Council and CCA Leaders. This identifies the combined efforts of both the student councillors and the various CCA leaders that have contributed towards their respective CCAs and school events for the past year.  
  
This year's investiture theme, 🌗"A Universe of Potential”🪐, celebrates diverse leadership, emphasising each leader's unique strengths and vision. It inspires hope, highlighting opportunities for growth and change, encouraging leaders to harness the potential of those they serve and foster collective efforts for excellence. 💫  
  
We thank the seniors for all of their contributions in bringing glory to VJC. Let us continue the good work and legacy that our seniors have left for us! Nil Sine Labore 🤟
