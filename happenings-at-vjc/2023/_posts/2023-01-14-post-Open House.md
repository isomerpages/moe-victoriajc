VJC threw open our gates and welcomed guests on 14 Jan 2023! Prospective students heard from our Principal, students and parents about the colourful lives of Victorians. Our campus was abuzz with activities at the subject and CCAs booths, and guests were entertained by our performing arts groups, buskers and flash mobs! Sâ€™mores were handed out, to symbolise the gooey goodness and camaraderie of our community! #vjsmore
