VJC celebrated the Class of 2022 on 17 Feb 2023, when they came back to receive their A-Level results. These Victorians made us proud, not just with their stellar results, but because they stood up to Lead, Serve and Excel, proving that Victoria Is Something More! A big Thank You to our teachers, parents and partners for your dedicated support of our students!
