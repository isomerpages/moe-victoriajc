To cap an awesome Term 1, Victorians came out to play in the sun! Games Day kicked off with the whole school doing the Neutron Dance. House competition was fierce, with House warriors facing off at Spartan Race, Prison Break, Mixed Medley Race, Frisbee, Floorball and many more games! Fringe activities brought truckloads of laughter and even the teachers traded red pens for Pickleball paddles! As March Holiday swing by, may we all have a restful and well-deserved break!
