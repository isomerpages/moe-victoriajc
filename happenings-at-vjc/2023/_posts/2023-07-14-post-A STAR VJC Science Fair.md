![](/images/Happening%20at%20VJC/Astarvjc.jpeg)The Victoria Junior College Science & Technology Centre has collaborated with the MOE and various institutes to provide opportunities for students and educators to develop their pursuits in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education.  
  
Last month, we hosted 250 students from 27 schools for the annual **A\*STAR-VJC Science Fair** where students shared their passion for STEM. VJC also hosted the **DSO-DSTA-VJC Robotics Challenge** where students from primary and secondary schools built and controlled ðŸ¤–robots remotely to play a game. The aim of the competition is to promote the learning of engineering skills, especially robotics and programming skills and the development of creative problem solving skills among students.Â   
  
Well done, students! We hope you keep your passion for STEM alive!
