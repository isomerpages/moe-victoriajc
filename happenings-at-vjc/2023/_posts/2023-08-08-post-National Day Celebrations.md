The sun shone bright on 8 Aug, for it never rains on our parade! 🌤️  National Day 2023 at VJC commenced with the college gathered at our Parade Square for the National Day Observance Ceremony. We were privileged to be joined by our special guest Dr Maliki Osman, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs.   
  
Victorians stood proudly to attention as the Symphonic Band performed rhythmic beats to accompany the marching in of the State Flag and the Colours flags. 🌈  Our JC2s later engaged in a lively and thought-provoking 💡National Day Dialogue while our JC1s created upcycled headbands and musical instruments in show of effort towards a sustainable SG. 🌳  
  
The commemoration of ND58 culminated in a dance display by our team of NDP dancers and a sing-a-long of a medley of National Day songs!
