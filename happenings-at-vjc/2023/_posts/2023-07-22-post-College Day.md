On 22nd July, we celebrated our 39th College Day! On this annual occasion, we look back on the year gone by, and recognize the achievements of our Victorians in various spheres. 
  
It’s also a chance to welcome back familiar faces and friends of the College to our campus. This year, we were pleased to have with us as **Guest-of-Honour Ms Liew Wei Li, Director-General of Education (MOE)**, who is also an alumna and former teacher at VJC!

We celebrated the achievement of our students and staff alike!   
  
The **Wong Hung Khim trophy for Student of the Year**, the College’s highest honour, was awarded to **Arshul Garg (21S47)**. Arshul was also Valedictorian for his cohort. **Fukushima Mizuki (21A12)** received the **Dr Ong Chit Chung Trophy for Outstanding Service to the College**, while **Song Eryue (21A11)** achieved the **Arts Alumni Humanities Excellence Award.**  
  
**Abdul Mateen Bin Abdul Malik (21S46)** was conferred the **Special Academic Achievement Award**. This award recognizes students who have offered 13 academic units and performed exceptionally at the A-Level exams – certainly no mean feat!  
  
Two of our veteran teachers, **Mrs Celine Leow and Mr Goh Eng Chai **received the **Singapore Public Service Valedictory Letter** for 43 years and 40 years of service respectively. Their decades-long dedication to teaching has no doubt had an impact on the lives of countless students they’ve worked with through the years.  
Congratulations to all award-recipients!   
  
Victoria is truly something more!
