Who's got EdVantage? We do! After a 3-year hiatus, on 26 July 2023, VJC's annual Careers, Scholarships & Higher Education Fair was back with a bang!  
  
Around 50 organisations from both public and private sectors, as well as institutions of higher learning, participated in the fair, to provide Victorians with a rich opportunity to learn about potential pathways for their future. Our partners and alumni also came to campus to share their insights and experiences.  
  
Victorians turned out in full force to actively explore and reflect on their career aspirations and personal goals, and align them with their higher education and scholarships choices.  
  
VJC would like to thank our partners and alumni for making this happen!
