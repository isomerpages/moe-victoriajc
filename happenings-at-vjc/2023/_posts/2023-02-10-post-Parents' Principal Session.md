On 10 Feb 2023, over 600 parents came to VJC to find out more about the JC system and various programmes designed for the holistic development of Victorians. At the main event, panelists comprising school leaders and key personnel addressed questions regarding the academic programme, educational and career guidance, scholarship opportunities and CCA offerings. Parents also heard the unique perspectives of our student leaders and Parents Support Group, to better understand how to support their children through their JC journey.
