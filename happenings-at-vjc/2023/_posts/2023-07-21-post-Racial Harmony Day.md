On 21 July 2023, VJC commemorated Racial Harmony Day! This year’s theme is ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’ and to celebrate our multicultural society, we were treated to a cultural dance showcase by VJC’s cultural societies. Everyone, both teachers and Victorians, came decked in their finest ethnic wear to commemorate the occasion. Our Parents’ Support Group also set up cultural and food booths for Victorians to immerse in our multicultural mosaic.
