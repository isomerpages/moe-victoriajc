VJC hosted Singapore’s 💫 inaugural ModelCOP 🌏 this November, to coincide with the upcoming COP28 that will be held in 🇦🇪 Dubai. In collaboration with the good folks of WISE Singapore and SMU, ModelCOP 2023 aims to expose Singaporean youths to issues in climate change, climate diplomacy and the different challenges and vulnerabilities different countries face today.   
  
Delegates had the privilege of engaging with a knowledgeable panel on the role of youth in sustainability- many thanks to passionate individuals. Delegates also researched and drafted resolutions on behalf of their repesentative countries, and participated in fiery negotiations, representing different perspectives. mCOP was certainly insightful and meaningful for all delegates.
