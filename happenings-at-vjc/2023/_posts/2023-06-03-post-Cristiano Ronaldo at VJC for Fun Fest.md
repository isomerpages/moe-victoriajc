VJC hosted Fun Fest for the Marine Parade Cluster and Victorians were treated to a siu-per afternoon with an appearance by none other than Cristiano Ronaldo! Praksheeta Kuppusamy (23S53) of our Tennis team played against CR7 in a game of padel and was left starstruck and inspired. Check out Praksheeta's thoughts on her experience in [this article](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/cristiano-ronaldo-lets-his-hands-do-the-talking-in-game-of-padel-at-vjc?fbclid=IwAR2P4gsLLj4lUZyg1LfPf6ET1TjPB_fG_TgkZhHuAdiFYwcW3cP367-D1SU) and click through [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtGw3NiLQ4N/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) for more shots from the event!
