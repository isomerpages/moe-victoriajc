Precious memories were made and forever friendships forged at JC1 Orientation 2023: Andromeda. Over 5 days, Orientation Group Leaders brought freshies on an initiation journey they would never forget! From learning the classic mass dances and school cheers, to discovering subject and CCA offerings, our new Victorians got all fired up and realised that the fun had just begun! On Day 5, they were joined by their seniors in a morning of bonding activities at Galax-Sea at ECP. Orientation ended with a blast with the traditional mass dance at Suntecâ€™s Fountain of Wealth!
