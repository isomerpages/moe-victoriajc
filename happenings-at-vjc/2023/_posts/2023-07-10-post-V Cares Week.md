VCares Week featured a range of activities planned by Victorians, for Victorians! From class breakfast to beads by numbers and kite making, Victorians took time off from the daily rigour of lessons for some bonding and mindfulness activities. We hope VCares Week is a good reminder for Victorians to take a step back to rest, relax and look out for one another.
