A group of big-hearted Victorians came together in aid of Hair for Hope, raising funds for children affected by Cancer. Additionally, they rallied their peers to shave their hair in solidarity of children with cancer. We are heartened to see Victorians actively engaged in Hair for Hope, either in raising funds, signing up as shavees or advocating for the cause.
