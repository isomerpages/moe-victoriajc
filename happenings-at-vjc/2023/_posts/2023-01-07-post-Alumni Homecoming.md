On 7 Jan 2023, over 3000 Victorians past and present congregated at our campus to reminisce and relive their happy school days! Games were played, food was shared, but the real highlight was catching up with the people they loved â€“ their friends and teachers for life! The event ended with a Special Assembly in the Hall, where everyone sang the Victorian Anthem, loud and proud! Victoria is Something More!
