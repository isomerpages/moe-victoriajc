With the growing sophistication of cyber-security threats locally and globally, this yearâ€™s Total Defence Week focused on Digital Security. The SG Secure Exhibition @ Concourse sensitised one and all to the threats present in our community and taught us how we can take action. During Civics lesson, students learnt about strategies to make the online space more secure via a Virtual Escape Room. At Assembly on 17 Feb 2023, Mr Wilson Tan, Senior Director of Cybersecurity Institute, Singtel and Mr Chris Wong, Director of Advanced Security Technologies, Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies shared their insights about the evolving digital landscape.
