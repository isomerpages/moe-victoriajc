<h4><strong>STEM Outreach</strong></h4>
<p>At VJC, we believe that STEM is not just about discovery—it's about building
a community of learners and leaders who inspire and drive progress. VJC
extends its passion for STEM beyond its classrooms, organising impactful
workshops, seminars, and competitions for primary and secondary school
students. Each year, these outreach programmes engage over 1,100 participants
from 50 schools nationwide, offering them unique opportunities to learn
and grow.</p>
<p>These sessions not only enrich the participants but also provide a platform
for Victorians to step into leadership roles. By planning, leading, and
executing these activities, Victorians share their passion for STEM while
honing critical skills such as teamwork, communication, and event management.</p>
