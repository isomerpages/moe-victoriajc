<p>AESOP is an enrichment opportunity for HSP students and Arts faculty students.
AESOP aims to develop a multi-disciplinary enrichment programme to complement
existing learning experiences for humanities subjects. Dive into the study
of Arts and Humanities, where Literature, Economics, History, Geography
and more, converge to illuminate the intricate tapestry of the human experience,
shaping cultures, histories, and societies. AESOP will create more opportunities
for the development of humanities talent, to build their competencies and
portfolio, and to foster a common VJC Arts Faculty identity in the process.</p>
<p>The Arts Enrichment Programme is open to all students in the Arts Stream.
In this multidisciplinary study, every question is a journey into the heart
of what makes us human. Authentic learning experiences abound for those
who choose to participate with enthusiasm.Through AESOP initiatives, an
Arts Faculty Student will be:</p>
