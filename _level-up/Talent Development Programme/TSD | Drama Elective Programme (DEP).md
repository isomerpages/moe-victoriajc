Theatre Studies and Drama (TSD) is a demanding yet rewarding A-Level subject aimed at students with a genuine interest in Theatre and Drama. Students need to conduct their own research and select material for monologues, duologues and group performances. Students also need to have a good level of spoken and written English and be able to work with initiative both as an individual and as part of a collaborative team.

TSD is designed to be part of a balanced A-Level programme and it is not a career-oriented training programme. Many students have actually gone on to pursue film/theatre/performing arts at a higher level but the course offers openings to a wide range of careers. The course emphasises independence, creativity and lateral thinking.  The course also rewards teamwork, resilience, and problem-solving. These skills help prepare students for any career that requires effective communication, imagination, initiative and collaboration – all the skills that are currently in demand, both in the government and the private sectors (in areas such as law, media, sales, teaching, advertising and management).**

      <p>Students study key texts in different genres and examine ways of approaching scripts from the point of view of a theatre maker. The theoretical side concerns aspects such as social, cultural and historical influences.</p>

<p>There are weekly practical workshops where the students explore the elements of drama, approaches to performance and different conventions and theatre styles. This includes areas such as mask, technical design (set, costume, and makeup), Physical Theatre, Experimental Theatre and the work of practitioners such as Brecht, Artaud, Boal and Stanislavski.</p>
