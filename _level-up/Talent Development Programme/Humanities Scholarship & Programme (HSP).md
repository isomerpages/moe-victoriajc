VJC is one of the centres for the MOE Humanities Scholarship & Programme (HSP).  The HSP offers scholars with the opportunity to immerse themselves in various disciplines which study aspects of human society and culture.  Apart from the inter-disciplinary overseas enrichment programme (OEP) which HSP Scholars will have an active role in planning, scholars also attend performances, extra-curricular talks, lectures and workshops. The objective of this is to widen scholars' exposure to the humanities and develop your appreciation and understanding of the arts across a variety of contexts.  In return, HSP Scholars are encouraged to share their learning with their juniors and the wider college community through various college and self-initiated platforms, including the VJC HSP Symposium.

*   Have a very good co-curricular activities record
*   Have good conduct record
