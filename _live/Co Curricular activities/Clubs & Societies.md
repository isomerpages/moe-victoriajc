<p>Victorians are fascinated with and curious about many aspects of our complex
world. As such, many clubs and societies cater to the plethora of&nbsp;interests.&nbsp;Whether
to deepen a passion or find a new hobby there is definitely&nbsp;a CCA&nbsp;that
suits&nbsp;our students'&nbsp;fancy.&nbsp; Our clubs and societies provide
Victorians with myriad ways and means to extend their knowledge on global
issues, the latest technological trends or medical breakthroughs. Various
fields of science and research are investigated while hearts and minds
are fulfilled via volunteerism and helping the needy. Worthy causes are
fought for and cultures explored via food, attire and dance, all while
developing sound leadership and organisational skills. Come delve into
another world where VJC’s clubs and societies will capture your imagination
and help you cultivate your interests.</p>
