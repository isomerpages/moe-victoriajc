<p>Yo VJC! What’s up? The ever –familiar cheer is heard loud and clear during
sports season at VJC.</p>
<p>If Performing Arts is the heart of VJC, then Sports is its soul. One of
the most exciting times of any given year falls during sports season. Many
of our teams have a legacy of victory, ensuring that Victorians carry it
on game after game, season after season. Always fired-up, Victorians play
with passion and pride that comes naturally to them. In a similar vein,
the rest of the college turns up behind them in full force supporting them
with all their might.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our dedicated teachers and trainers provide Victorians with the opportunity
to build skills such as good character, strong leadership and teamwork.
Through each sport, Victorians develop a championship mentality and the
skills to match.</p>
<p>VJC has a range of facilities for our sportsmen and women to develop their
athletic talent. Beyond the full-length synthetic field, 9-lane track,
mini-hockey field and tennis courts, Victorians have access to an air-conditioned
hall and a sheltered court. Across the road, East Coast Parkway provides
an ideal venue for Cross-Country, Sailing, outdoor camp craft, Orientation
activities, and general relaxation!</p>
