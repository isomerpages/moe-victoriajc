Civics at VJC aims to equip our students with the skills to navigate the turbulent waters of adolescence and also to prepare them for life beyond the classroom. It strives to help students develop&nbsp;&nbsp;a strong set of values, an entire suite of&nbsp;intra-personal&nbsp;and&nbsp;inter-personal&nbsp;skills centred around 21st century competencies,&nbsp;as well as mapping out their future through a structured and comprehensive programme of higher education and career guidance.

### CIVICS @ VJC

Connect 2 sessions are scheduled meetings where the Civics Tutor will meet students in their CT group for one-to-one meetings throughout the course of the year. By structuring such sessions with our students, we emphasise to students that they are important to us, and that we care about them and their needs.

Possible discussion topics for Connect 2

*   Student’s General Well Being: academic, family, social
*   Goals &amp; Targets: academic and non-academic&nbsp;
*   Potential: mentoring them to be the best they can be
*   Values

Feeling Fab is a day of fun, learning and enjoyment organised by the Civics Committee for JC1 students. Students get to select from a range of activities and participate in the activity of their choice as a class. This is an excellent opportunity for class bonding. Feeling Fab provides an avenue where the school supports and encourages them to go beyond their zone of experience and try things they normally would not do.
