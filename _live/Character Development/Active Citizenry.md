The Active Citizenry programme in VJC aims to develop in our students an understanding of what it means to be a Singaporean and a global citizen. This objective is achieved through both the National Education programme and Values-in-Action (VIA) projects. Through a framework of 'Expose, Inspire and Lead', experiences are designed in a manner to enable students to progressively deepen their involvement as active citizens in their communities. Together with other co-curricular programmes, these experiences complement the development of 21st century competencies needed for Victorians to be future-ready citizens.

### ACTIVE CITIZENRY PROGRAMS


| Citizenship Education @VJC | Service Leadership Venture | 
| :--------: | :--------: |
| At VJC, we aim to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and boost students' confidence in our nation's future through the commemoration of significant events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. To cultivate a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore, we host SG Perspectives Dialogues with Senior Civil Servants and Office Holders     | To encourage students to be active in community involvement, VJC launched the Service Leadership Venture. This programme was born out of the college’s move towards Service Leadership which focuses on how students can further enhance their leadership skills through active service to the community. </br></br>The SLV empowers and encourages students to develop class based service learning projects with different segments of the community ranging from environmental conservation, elder care, special needs, to palliative care.     | 



|  **Project V**| **VJCares** | **School-Wide VIAs** |
| :--------:| :--------: | :--------:|
| The aim of Project V is to enable Victorians to meaningfully engage with the community, so as to better understand their needs and begin considering ways to empower the under-served and make their lives better. Project V’s community partners are devoted to a range of causes and serve diverse needs, from environmental conservation to eldercare, special needs and end-of-life care.     | At VJC, we believe in empowering students to give back to their community. VJCares are self-initiated and /or community led projects by students based on their own interests and passions.     | School-wide VIAs involve the entire Victorian community, which comes out in full force to participate in events and special projects such as Walk for Rainbows and the 2018 Step Up challenge. Our staff also engage in VIAs such as activities like food distribution to the under-privileged and outings with the elderly! |
