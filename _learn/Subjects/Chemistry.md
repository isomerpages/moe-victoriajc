<p>Curious about the marvels of Chemistry? Ready to dive into the world of molecules and reactions?</p><p>Chemistry concepts can often seem abstract, so our goal is to actively involve students in learning these ideas through interactive methods like hands-on activities, demonstrations, discussions, and technology-based tools. For instance, we employ visual aids such as molecular models, diagrams, or charts to elucidate molecular structures and chemical reactions. Prior to class discussions, students will engage in online learning to acquire foundational knowledge, facilitating more meaningful and engaging conversations in class, often in unique contexts. Our practical lessons are crafted to deepen students' comprehension of the subject while fostering scientific inquiry skills.</p>
