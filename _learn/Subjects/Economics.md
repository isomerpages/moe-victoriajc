<p>Noticed your plate of chicken rice getting pricier over the years? Wondering
why some countries offer free healthcare and education while others don’t?</p>
<p>Study Economics in VJC! Learn how consumers, firms and governments make
decisions every day — from how prices of different goods and services are
set in the market, to how firms decide whether to utilise their profits
to expand or innovate, and even to how governments decide whether to build
a new railway line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can look forward to engaging class discussions and meaningful group
activities, where you will be challenged to stretch your mind and hone
your critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excited to have you on board!</p>
