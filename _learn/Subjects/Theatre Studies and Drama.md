<p>Ready to step into the spotlight? Curious about the world behind the curtain?</p>
<p></p>
<p>VJC is the pioneer in Theatre Studies and Drama (TSD)! Engage in both
theory and practice. Explore and express ideas through dramatic forms and
theatre conventions. Gain insights of theatre and drama in various historical
and cultural settings.</p>
<p>TSD is a demanding yet rewarding A-Level subject aimed at students with
a genuine interest in Theatre and Drama. Students need to conduct their
own research and select material for monologues, duologues and group performances.
Students also need to have a good level of spoken and written English and
be able to work with initiative both as an individual and as part of a
collaborative team.</p>
<p>TSD is designed to be part of a balanced A-Level programme and it is not
a career-oriented training programme. Many students have actually gone
on to pursue film/theatre/performing arts at a higher level but the course
offers openings to a wide range of careers. The course emphasises independence,
creativity and lateral thinking.&nbsp; The course also rewards teamwork,
resilience, and problem-solving. These skills help prepare students for
any career that requires effective communication, imagination, initiative
and collaboration â€“ all the skills that are currently in demand, both in
the government and the private sectors (in areas such as law, media, sales,
teaching, advertising and management).</p>
