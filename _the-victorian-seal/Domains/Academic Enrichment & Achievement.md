<p>Academic success at VJC goes beyond grades.</p>
<p>We nurture a "learning to learn" mindset where Victorians are encouraged
to have a zest for knowledge. They stretch their thinking, embrace academic
rigour, and become critical, adaptive, creative thinkers ready to tackle
real-world problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>At VJC, you nurture curiosity, think critically and adaptively, and learn to learn – for life.</em></strong>
