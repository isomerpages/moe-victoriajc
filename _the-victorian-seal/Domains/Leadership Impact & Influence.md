<p>Leadership at VJC is not defined by position, but by purpose and influence.</p>
<p>We lead with heart, humility, and integrity — drawing others into a shared
vision and becoming role models grounded in service and excellence.</p>
<p>Victorians foster a strong sense of camaraderie through peer support and
action. This is leadership that uplifts, unites, and rallies Victorians
towards a shared vision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>Be a good influence, build camaraderie, lead and serve with excellence.</em>
