<p>The Victorian SEAL is our commitment that every Victorian is <strong>holistically developed</strong>,
grounded in <strong>strong core values</strong> and <strong>ready for the challenges of the future</strong>.
It is a frame that places our <strong>College Values</strong> and the <strong>Emerging 21st Century Competencies</strong> at
the centre of the Victorian experience.</p>
<p>These <strong>values and competencies</strong> are demonstrated, discerned,
and developed via the four SEAL domains. All Victorians will benefit from
a strong academic programme, and will be given opportunities to <strong>lead, serve, and excel</strong> in
the classroom, their CCAs, and ad-hoc opportunities.</p>
<p>Through it all, Victorians will be guided by the <strong>Victorian Village</strong> –
a community of teachers to provide <strong>feedback and coaching</strong> to
each student, with peers to encourage and cheer them on too.<em> </em><strong><em>#vgotyourback</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Through SEAL, every Victorian is empowered to <strong>choose their own “Outstanding”</strong>,
defining what excellence means to them and growing into their fullest potential.
They graduate with the Victorian SEAL, as Victorians who are not just ready
for the world, but ready to shape it.</p>
