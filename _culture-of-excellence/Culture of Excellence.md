Victoria Junior College (VJC) was established in 1984 and quickly became a college of distinction. The College has grown from strength to strength, nurturing Victorians who have made their mark in society, from the academic, business, and public sectors to the arts and sport arenas.  
  
As a Victorian, you can expect to be engaged in learning that develops your talent, character and leadership, and just as importantly, you will forge strong friendships and create memories that will last beyond your school years.

#### Victoria is Something More

#### Lead. Serve. Excel.

Our College Vision - Victoria is Something More: Lead, Serve, Excel - stems from our college anthem and encapsulates the spirit of challenging Victorians to be better, and to go above and beyond in their pursuit of excellence. 

At Victoria Junior College, we aim to nurture Victorians who are committed to all-round excellence, yet being deeply anchored in values. Victorians will develop as individuals, and as part of the larger community, become leaders who lead with courage, serve the college and community with conviction and compassion, and excel in their areas of passion and interest.

We remain steadfast in our mission to ignite the imagination of all Victorians to create the future with conviction, courage and compassion. Our values keep us rooted to what Victoria Junior College stands for and to what we hold dear - camaraderie, excellence with integrity, and conviction, courage and compassion in our thoughts and actions.

### The Victorian Anthem

Victoria in Singapore,  
There are other schools we know.  
Victoria is something more,  
The school that watch’d us grow.  
For here we’ve learnt and striven too,  
And played the sportsman’s game.  
Victoria, we give to you  
The honour that you claim.

Victoria, thy sons are we  
And we will not forget.  
Victoria, thy triumphs see  
And victories we share yet.  
For others came before and went  
And carried to the world  
Victoria’s fame and our intent  
To keep her flag unfurled.

**Lyrics by:** J A Frazer  
**Music by:** W E Meyer

### Our Crest

##### **Yellow**

Yellow is the colour of royalty in Asian cultures. In our context today, it takes on the meanings that were once associated with royalty, including DIGNITY, leadership and a concern for the welfare of others.

##### **Red**

Red symbolises the UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD AND EQUALITY OF HUMANITY.

##### **Book**

The open book symbolises the KNOWLEDGE and WISDOM acquired through lifelong learning.

##### **Torch**

The torch symbolises TRUTH and the passing on of a tradition.  
It also illuminates the way of Victorians who venture forth to excel beyond Singaporean shores.
