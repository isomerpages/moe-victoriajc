The idea of Victoria Junior College was first mooted in the 1970s by distinguished Victorians such as Mr Wong Hung Khim, Mr Foo Kok Swee and Mr Ong Teong Pin. Led by Mr Wong Hung Khim, the first Chairman of the Victoria Advisory Committee (VAC) and Victoria Executive Committee (VEC), and supported by Dr Ong Chit Chung, the President of Old Victorians’ Association from 1978 to 1981 and later Chairman of the VAC and VEC, the proposal for a new junior college was submitted to the Ministry of Education.

This vision was soon realised, and a new phase in the history of Victoria took shape with the setting up of Victoria Junior College (VJC) along Marine Vista. In 1984, the College received its first batch of students under the leadership of VJC’s first principal, Mrs Lee Phui Mun. Mrs Lee went on to be principal for 18 years, and led the College to breaking new ground in several areas. She was succeeded as principal by Mrs Chan Kah Gek (2002-2006), followed by Mr Chan Poh Meng (2007-2013) and Miss Ek Soo Ben (2014-current). Under the astute and inspiring leadership of its principals, VJC has scaled new heights and is now recognised as a centre for academic, sporting and cultural excellence.
