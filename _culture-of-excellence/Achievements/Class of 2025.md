<p>The Class of 2025 has completed the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination,
and we are proud to celebrate their outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>Over two years, the Victorians of the Class of 2025 excelled across academics,
CCAs, service and leadership. They met challenges head-on, persevered through
demanding seasons, and continued to show up for one another.</p>
<p>Class of 2025, you completed your final lap in VJC with grit and grace,
and we are proud not only of what you have accomplished, but of the people
you have become.</p>
<p>Our deepest appreciation to our teachers, parents, and partners for your
steadfast support in nurturing, guiding, and journeying alongside our students. <em>Nil Sine Labore!</em>

<h3>LEAD</h3>
<p><strong>Muhammad Edel Mahbub Harahap | Victoria School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>As Captain of the Victoria Junior College Floorball Team, Edel led with
resilience and teamwork, playing a pivotal role in motivating his team
and securing National School Games A Division Boys titles in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>Beyond the court, he extended his leadership to the community — representing
VJC at LKCMedicine Med Camp, co-founding Project Elpida to promote inclusion
with the Singapore Disability Sports Council, and engaging seniors in thoughtful
sessions on AI through a Service Leadership Venture.</p>
<p>Edel shows that true leadership lies not just in achievement, but in uplifting
others every step of the way.</p>

<p><strong>Cheryl Koh Xin Yu | Cedar Girls' School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Cheryl exemplifies purposeful leadership through excellence, service,
and impact. As a recipient of the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round
Excellence alongside the Goh Chok Tong Outstanding Student Leader Award,
MOE Pre-University Scholarship and VJC Scholarship, Cheryl’s academic brilliance
and leadership excellence shine through every endeavour she undertakes.
As Vice-Chairperson of the Dance Club, Cheryl’s dedicated leadership guided
the team to achieve a Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentation 2025, while bringing energy to the stage in
key college events.</p>
<p>Beyond her personal achievements, Cheryl's heart for service was what
made her truly outstanding. As Co-Leader of the Youth Corps Leaders Programme's
KidsCount Boon Lay project, she championed numeracy education for underprivileged
primary school children. Her community impact was recognised when she received
the Singapore Silent Heroes Award in 2025, a testament to the impact of
her genuine care for others. Cheryl's remarkable ability to nurture potential
in others whilst building inclusive communities makes her a beacon of inspiration!</p>

<p><strong>Aaron Jacob | Victoria School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>A recipient of the VJC Scholarship, Aaron’s leadership journey is marked
by both excellence and impact. As President of the 41st Students’ Council,
he led with clarity and heart, orchestrating key college milestones such
as JCO, VJC Open House, and the VJC 40th Anniversary Gala Dinner — bringing
people together through steady leadership and genuine care for the community.</p>
<p>Beyond his formal role, Aaron consistently used his initiative and voice
to serve others, leading and contributing to projects like Project Cognitio
and Project MediLens, and conducting outreach workshops with Montfort Care’s
GoodLife Bedok Reservoir to engage and uplift learners of all ages.</p>
<p>Grounded in curiosity and driven by purpose, Aaron exemplifies leadership
that goes beyond achievement — leadership that builds connection, empowers
others, and leaves a lasting impact. We can’t wait to see where his journey
leads next.</p>
