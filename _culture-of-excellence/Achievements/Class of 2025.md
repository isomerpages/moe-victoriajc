resilience and teamwork, playing a pivotal role in motivating his team
and securing National School Games A Division Boys titles in 2024 and 2025.</p>

with the Singapore Disability Sports Council, and engaging seniors in thoughtful
sessions on AI through a Service Leadership Venture.</p>

primary school children. Her community impact was recognised when she received

<p>A recipient of the VJC Scholarship, Aaron’s leadership journey is marked
by both excellence and impact. As President of the 41st Students’ Council,
he led with clarity and heart, orchestrating key college milestones such

to serve others, leading and contributing to projects like Project Cognitio
and Project MediLens, and conducting outreach workshops with Montfort Care’s

<h3>Serve</h3>
<p><strong>Muhammad Darwisy bin Khalid | Dunman Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Balancing rhythm and responsibility, Darwisy made the most of his time
at VJC by throwing himself wholeheartedly into both student life and service.A
committed member of the VJC Dance Club, Darwisy brought energy, discipline,
and creativity to the stage, performing at key College events and representing
the College at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Dance was
more than a CCA for him; it was a space where teamwork, resilience, and
self-expression came together, shaping his confidence and sense of commitment.</p>
<p>Beyond the stage, Darwisy lived out our #VGotYourBack spirit. As a Mathematics
peer tutor, mentor to Secondary Four students, and Orientation Group Leader,
he consistently put others first — guiding, encouraging, and supporting
his peers while balancing his own commitments. His commitment to service
also extended beyond school. Darwisy volunteered with PERTAPIS’ Ramadhan
Food on Wheels initiative and, alongside his family, took part in SalamSG’s
Korban food distribution. For Darwisy, carving out time to serve the community
with his family is a norm and reflects a quiet consistency in how he chooses
to give back, even amid a full student life.</p>
<p>Whether on stage, in school leadership roles, or in service to the community,
Darwisy exemplifies a student who leads with dedication, empathy, and purpose.</p>

commitment to service and community engagement. As an Active Citizenry
Representative, he not only led his class in a Values in Action (VIA) initiative
but also co-designed an interactive role-playing game for Total Defence
Day. The thoughtfully crafted experience resonated strongly with his peers,
reflecting his creativity, sense of responsibility, and ability to make
complex national issues accessible and meaningful. He further broadened
his service perspective through an Overseas VIA at the end of JC1.</p>
<p>Beyond school-based initiatives, Abhiraj has been a regular volunteer
with Beyond Social Services, contributing his time to support the wider
community. In JC2, he also tutored his peers in Mathematics, offering steady
academic support and guidance. Through both structured programmes and informal
acts of service, Abhiraj has shown a sincere desire to uplift others and
create positive impact within and beyond the college community.</p>

instrumental role in shaping meaningful learning experiences for Arts Faculty
students as well as Secondary Four students from partner schools, demonstrating
both initiative and a deep commitment to collaborative learning.</p>

Relations Committee member, he designed bonding activities for JC1 Orientation,
making freshmen feel welcomed and supported.</p>

<h3>Excel</h3>
<p><strong>Tan Chia Lok Gerald | Victoria School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Balancing A-Level exams and national sporting commitments is no small
feat — but Gerald did it with discipline, resilience and quiet leadership.</p>
<p>A consistent pillar of the VJC Floorball Team, he played a key role in
securing back-to-back NSG A Division Boys titles (2024 and 2025), including
converting the decisive penalty in the 2024 final. Beyond school, Gerald
represented Singapore on the international stage as U19 Team Captain, leading
the team through multiple competitions. Shortly after completing his A-Level
examinations, Gerald also competed at the 33rd SEA Games in Bangkok, Thailand,
securing a Bronze medal with the Men’s National Team. Training through
the examination period required careful planning and mental fortitude,
underscoring his commitment to representing Singapore while fulfilling
his academic responsibilities, and earning him the VJC Scholarship.</p>
<p>Approachable, committed and steady under pressure, Gerald’s journey reflects
the balance, responsibility and determination of a true student-athlete.</p>

<p><strong>Alexis Kwek Lexin | Tanjong Katong Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Having received both the MOE Pre-University Scholarship and the VJC Scholarship,
Alexis showed herself to be a stellar student. But her love for learning
goes far beyond textbooks — whether in biology competitions or leading
her peers, she thrives on making a difference.</p>
<p>Her passion for the life sciences has led to impressive achievements:
an Honourable Mention at the 2024 Singapore Biology Olympiad, a Gold Award
at the 2025 Singapore Biology League, and top performance in the NTU Lee
Kong Chian Anatomy Challenge 2025, where she and her team tackled advanced
anatomy questions, including in-depth studies of the human reproductive
system. Alexis also deepened her medical insights through the NUS Healthcare
Outreach Programme, the National Healthcare Medical Symposium, and a job
shadowing stint at NUH’s Department of Pathology, strengthening her resolve
to pursue a future in healthcare.</p>
<p>As a Chairperson of the College’s Global Affairs Society (iGlobe), she
has led her team in organising impactful events like the Singapore Model
Cabinet, navigating challenges with strategies and collaboration.</p>
<p>We celebrate Alexis for her curiosity and dedication to making a difference.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Divyansh Jain | Victoria School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Divyansh exemplifies excellence through a rare balance of intellect, leadership
and drive. A recipient of the SPF Book Prize and an award winner in national
and international academic competitions, he consistently pushed the boundaries
of scholarly achievement. Beyond the classroom, he led with the same discipline
and vision—as Vice-Captain of the basketball team, and an enterprising
member of VEconomist who embraced innovation and initiative.</p>
<p>What truly elevates Divyansh is his commitment to collective success.
By co-founding UpNext Scientists, he expanded access to research opportunities
for underprivileged students, while his patient peer tutoring reflected
a belief that growth is amplified when shared. Whether in academics, sports
or service, Divyansh excels not only by striving for personal distinction
but by creating impact and opening doors for others along the way.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Goh Li Xin | Tanjong Katong Girls' School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Meet Li Xin, a student whose journey has been defined by vibrant energy
and a steady, positive presence across campus!</p>
<p>As a key player on our Netball team, Li Xin showed true grit through hours
of intensive training, helping her team secure consecutive National School
Games podium finishes in 2024 and 2025. Her resilience on the court was
matched by her leadership off it as she headed the Victorian Affair and
led her peers with a consultative approach to create a memorable experience
for her cohort.</p>
<p>Li Xin’s heart for service is equally evident. From mentoring her peers
in Mathematics to supporting children with autism to teaching technology
to seniors, she managed her diverse commitments with a genuine smile and
clear purpose. Her ability to balance the rigours of her A-Level journey
with such impactful community work highlights her exceptional time management
and empathy for others. Her courage, conviction and compassion were recognised
when she was awarded the VJC Scholarship.</p>
<p>We’re proud to celebrate Li Xin—an athlete, a leader, and a role model
for well-rounded excellence. We look forward to the positive impact she
will continue to make in her next chapter!</p>

<h3>INSPIRE</h3>
<p><strong>Ong Tze Hsien Joshua | Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Joshua inspires by redefining leadership through presence, energy and
resilience. A constant force in VJC life, he showed that effective leaders
do not need physical speed to make an impact—only conviction and heart.
Whether as an Orientation Group Leader or a peer tutor, Joshua led with
charisma, patience and determination, excelling academically while uplifting
those around him.</p>
<p>His inspiration lies equally in service and empathy. From shaping national-level
discussions through iGlobe and the Singapore Model Cabinet to mentoring
a cancer survivor and supporting anxious juniors, Joshua consistently turned
personal challenges into strength for others. As he leaves VJC, he stands
as a powerful reminder that true leadership is about connection, compassion
and the courage to serve beyond oneself.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Goh Xin Zhi Elizabeth | Temasek Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s journey is one of resilience and creativity. Returning to
Singapore, she transformed the challenge of feeling out of place into a
drive to grow, emerging as a vibrant presence at VJC. Entering through
DSA (Theatre Studies) and being awarded the Humanities Scholarship, she
flourished as a writer, director and actor, and contributing to award-winning
performances and embracing opportunities from local showcases to international
exposure.</p>
<p>What makes Elizabeth truly inspiring is how she turned her own struggles
into empathy for others. As Drama Club Head of Welfare and an Orientation
Group Leader, she led with compassion, helping peers and juniors find a
sense of belonging. Her service—spanning animal welfare to hospice care—reflects
a belief that home is built through kindness and connection. Elizabeth
reminds us that inspiration lies not just in standing out, but in lifting
others up and making them feel at home.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Kaela Si-Hoe Shu En | Methodist Girls' School</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;Photo&gt;</p>
<p>In her time in VJC, Kaela was known as a steady presence on the court
and a quiet leader beyond it. As a core player of VJC Netball, Kaela was
someone the team leaned on in high-pressure moments — anchoring play with
composure, discipline, and heart, and helping secure 2nd runners-up at
the A Division NSG in 2024 and 2025. Balancing sport and studies while
navigating dyslexia, she reminds us that growth happens at your own pace,
and confidence follows when you’re supported.</p>
<p>Beyond sports, she led with empathy, rallying her teammates to give back
through community service and creating inclusive, meaningful experiences
for others. Through every challenge and triumph, she carries herself with
humility, resilience, and purpose. VJC is proud of the leader she has become.</p>
