719 Victorians sat for the 2021 Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination. We are proud to announce that they have achieved an excellent set of results.

1 out of 2 students attained a University Admission Score of at least 85 Rank Points, which places them strongly for competitive courses in university.

2 out of 5 students achieved a distinction in all 4 of their Higher Two subjects.

We congratulate students who attained outstanding results, with 130 students garnering at least 6 distinctions for their subjects.

This cohort had sat for their Project Work examination in 2020, with about 9 in 10 achieving distinctions.

Congratulations to the Cohort of 2020! We are very proud of you and wish you the very best for your future endeavours.

A big ‘Thank You’ goes out to our teachers, parents and partners for your dedicated support of our students’ efforts.

Nil Sine Labore!

Gilda and Kiran took on their leadership roles as members of the 38th Students’ Council during a time of myriad challenges posed by the COVID-19 situation. Despite this, they fulfilled their duties with resilience during their term of office. They met every difficulty with fervour, simultaneously inspiring their peers to do the same.

As Vice-President of the Students’ Council, Gilda was keenly aware of the need to keep morale high and keep the school spirit alive. Together with her team of councillors, they racked their brains to plan engaging events for the student body. It was during this process that she established her trademark leadership style – one focused on empowering them and inspiring them to serve from the heart. Despite the recurring setbacks that the pandemic posed, Gilda was always grateful for the support from her peers and teachers which kept her going.

Kiran served on the Students’ Council’s Executive Committee as General Secretary. He too strove to help Victorians gain meaningful experiences during their time in the school, believing in the importance of a cohesive and participative student body. Kiran harbours an abiding appreciation for the almost familial support network existing in the school. He has fond memories of this togetherness and how it allowed his cohort to experience the shared Victorian spirit even when the pandemic forced them to be physically apart.

Both Gilda and Kiran shared the belief that VJC is more than the sum of its parts. They were unstinting in their mentorship of their juniors during CLiC (Connecting Leaders in Camp), in hopes of supporting the next generation of student leaders.

In the course of their dedicated service to the College, they wholeheartedly supported others in their endeavours, and have inspired succeeding batches of student-leaders. For their dedication in serving the college and community, they have both been recently awarded the Goh Chok Tong NextGen Outstanding Leader Award. Indeed, they have shown why Victoria is truly something more.
