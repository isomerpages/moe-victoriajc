<h4>Excel</h4>
<p><strong>Faith Ford, CHIJ St. Joseph‚Äôs Convent | </strong><em><u>#whyvj </u>The teachers truly look out for us, asking how I‚Äôm coping, checking in on me, or even asking if I‚Äôve eaten. During NSG, when we miss classes for competitions, they were very understanding and happily book consults for us to keep us on track. I really appreciate their patience with me because I always have a million questionsü§£. That my teachers had my back really played a big part in ensuring I could juggle sports and academics. I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten through JC without their support :))</em>

<p>Faith‚Äôs story is one of how her passion and determination to excel in
her CCAs - Cross Country and Track and Field - led her down the path of
sporting history. She started running competitively only in Secondary 4
but blossomed during her time with the VJC Cross Country and Track and
Field teams. As the Captain of the Cross Country team, she displayed great
dedication to her role and was a strong motivating force for her team during
training. While she was the fastest individual at the 2022 NSG Cross Country
Championships, the team collectively clinched third position. Undeterred,
she and her peers trained even harder, putting on a stellar performance
at the 2023 edition of the Championships and reclaimed the team title that
VJC last won in 2016.</p>

Championship records but also national school records for Track and Field.
Her exceptional performance led her to be selected to represent Singapore
in the 2023 Under-20 Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea. For
her athletic excellence and tenacious spirit, Faith was awarded the VJC
Sports Excellence Award in 2022, and the Singapore Sports Council Colours
Award (Distinction) for being the Best Sports Girl for Cross Country. VJC
