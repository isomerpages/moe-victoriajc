Going the Extra Mile (VGEMs) Award, and more admirably, Aufal was also
awarded the prestigious Singapore Silent Heroes (Student) Award in 2024

(Post Secondary) Pickleball Tournament organised by the Singapore Pickleball
Association and Pesta Sukan in 2023, and placing First Runners-Up. In addition

<p>A true force of nature and an incredible leader. Not only was she the
Chairperson of the VJC Dance Club, but she also broke stereotypes by being
one of only three girls taking Computing – an area typically dominated
by boys.</p>
<p>During the intense National Day Parade period, Beatrice truly shined.
Managing the operations of over 100 participants with such poise and precision,
she made sure everything ran smoothly. Her leadership skills were unparalleled
- firm yet friendly, authoritative yet caring, Beatrice had a unique ability
to balance it all. She inspired every student involved to give their best,

from competition, he took on the role of assistant coach, helping to guide
and support his juniors with his expertise as a black belt and certified
coach.</p>
<p>Jarrett's leadership extends beyond his duties. His charisma and likability
shine through as he leads by example, always putting in the hard work alongside

</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 A Level Results/7.jpg">
</div>
<p>Sneha matriculated in VJC as a Science student, but after a year, realised
that her interests lay in the Arts and Humanities domains and took the
brave step to redo JC1 as an Arts student. Her genuine interest and inclination
towards the Arts was unmistakable, seen in her selection as an MOE Humanities
Scholarship Programme recipient.</p>
<p>While Sneha took a little longer to find her passion, she truly thrived
as an Arts student. Her tutors and peers valued her contributions in class
- she was articulate, perceptive and always willing to share her views,
yet respectful of differing perspectives. Sneha participated actively in
college life and was not only engaged in her CCA, Art Club, but was also
an emcee for VJC’s Teachers’ Day celebration and Guitar Ensemble’s public

<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 A Level Results/8.jpg">
</div>
<p>Maria’s education journey was not a straight path. A perfectionist at
heart, she struggled to meet her expectations and decided to leave VJC
at the start of JC2 to pursue her studies in a Polytechnic instead. There,
she was actively engaged in various activities there but ultimately decided
that the A-Level route was more&nbsp; suited for her and thus returned
to VJC. Though Maria had difficulties adjusting back to the JC curriculum,
she plucked her courage and with grit, persisted and soon found her footing.</p>
<p>Through the camaraderie and support from her classmates and teachers,
Maria integrated herself well and once again thrived and immersed herself
in school life. Despite having to make constant adjustments to her school
environment, Maria’s heart for the community remained evident. She was
a regular and committed volunteer with the Ground-Up Initiative (GUI),
a non-profit organisation known for environmental sustainability and community-building
efforts. Maria’s exceptional maturity, together with her tenacity when
things get tough are truly inspiring for her peers.</p>
