<h4>Lead</h4>
<p><strong>Philicia Geow, CHIJ Katong Convent | </strong><em><u>#whyVJ</u> The community in VJC is one that spurs you on no matter your background. It has given me friends who care for me even at my lowest point. I have graduated knowing that the memories and friends I made here will last a lifetime.</em>

</div>
<p>With nurturing guidance and loving support of family, teachers and friends,
Philicia has blossomed into a confident learner and dynamic leader. For
her achievements, she was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Outstanding
Normal Course Students in 2022. In the same year, she was elected by the
student body to be the President of the 39<sup>th</sup> Studentsâ€™ Council.
Philicia was steadfast in her values and led the Council decisively. When
collaborating with other councillors on projects, she was empathetic and
facilitative, making sure to consider multiple perspectives and to leverage
on the strengths of different team members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keen to keep her finger on the pulse of society, Philicia embraced community
involvement opportunities beyond college. In 2022, Philicia was part of
the organising committee of Project Bread &amp; Butter, an initiative which
helped to raise awareness of food insecurity in Singapore and raise funds
for Food Bank Singapore. Despite having to cope with a rigorous A-Level
curriculum, which includes Theatre Studies &amp; Drama, and her Council
duties, Philicia found time to commit as a volunteer tutor for under-privileged
lower secondary school students with =DREAMS Asia in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philicia embodies the values of a true Victorian, leading and serving
with courage and compassion.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan Gan, Victoria School | </strong><em><u>#whyVJ</u> VJC has been a safe space for me to fully express myself. The warmth of my peers and support of my teachers has been so important to me and I will miss it. This has been definitive in my VJ journey.</em>
</p>

<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2025/Dylan.jpg">
</div>
<p>Although new to Track &amp; Field, Dylan embraced the sport with great
aplomb. Dedicating hours to training, Dylan contributed to his teamâ€™s podium
placing at the National School Games Track &amp; Field A Division Boys
Championships in 2023. For his athletic excellence, he was awarded the
Singapore Schools Sports Council Colours Award in the same year.</p>
<p>A multi-talented individual, Dylan was also the Chief Photographer of
the VJC Photography Society. He took many well-composed photographs to
document college events and designed workshops to impart his knowledge
and skills about photography with fellow enthusiasts. In addition, Dylan
streamlined and improved the operational systems and processes of the Photography
Society, allowing it to function more effectively when collaborating with
the college community.</p>
<p>As Captain of the Track &amp; Field Boysâ€™ Team and Chief Photographer
of Photography Society, Dylan demonstrated strong leadership qualities.
Recognised as a charismatic and effective leader, he was appointed the
overall student leader in-charge of the Victoria-Cedar Alliance Initiation
Programme. He communicated plans with clarity and zeal and helped to organise
Project V, a community service project. VJC would like to thank Dylan for
his inspirational leadership and we are certain we will see more of him
in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Sherwyn Peck, Bowen Secondary School | </strong><em><u>#whyVJ</u> VJ provided me with so many opportunities, where I got to perform and develop myself as a leader. It made me a better person and I am grateful for that.</em>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2025/Sherwyn.jpg">
</div>
<p>Sherwynâ€™s passion for dance placed him in the spotlight. A talented and
charismatic performer, he shone in every item he participated in during
Dance concerts. As the Chairperson of Dance Club, Sherwyn was fiercely
dedicated and a great source of motivation to his team. He made sure he
was familiar with different styles and techniques of dancing and able to
execute the moves flawlessly. He often took the initiative to guide those
struggling with the choreography. His leadership of the Club was rewarded
when it was awarded the Certificate of Distinction in the 2023 Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation.</p>
<p>When VJC was invited to participate in the 2023 National Day Parade Go-Live
segment, Sherwyn stepped up to lead the training sessions and helped teach
the dance moves to more than 100 student participants, most of whom were
not dancers. He was always ready to guide his peers and paid attention
to their welfare throughout the long hours of rehearsals. With the A-Level
exams on the horizon, Sherwyn was a role model of resilience and holistic
education as he motivated the JC2 participants to balance both their NDP
commitments and their academic pursuits skillfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The college is extremely proud of Sherwyn and how he has grown as a dancer
and leader.</p>

<h4>Serve</h4>
<p><strong>Faith Lum, Cedar Girlsâ€™ Secondary School | </strong><em><u>#whyvj</u> The fun-loving and supportive community in VJ has allowed me to meet so many amazing people and I'm truly grateful to have them in my life. My friends and teachers have also helped me create happy core memories that will definitely last a lifetime!</em>

<p>A kind and compassionate individual, Faith was always looking for opportunities
to serve the community. Driven by genuine tenderness and an innate desire
to empower others, she used her artistic talents to create merchandise
to raise funds for initiatives like Project Sunny Days, which aimed to
help raise awareness for and improve the plight of migrant workers. Faith
also dedicated countless hours to help out at Oasis Second Chance Animal
Shelter, taking dogs for walks and cleaning their cages. Faithâ€™s passion
to serve was also evident in school. She led her class in their Service
Leadership Venture project and was an Orientation Group Leader, showing
her juniors the ropes and helping them integrate well in VJC. As a testament
of her deep and genuine care for her community, Faith was awarded the Singapore
Silent Heroes Students Award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith was also a dedicated member of the Cross Country and Track and Field
Teams. Her hard work and discipline saw her achieve excellence in both
sports.&nbsp; In the 2023 National School Games Track and Field A Division
Girls Championships, Faith achieved Second Place in the 800m individual
event. Faith also played an instrumental role in her teamâ€™s top spot in
the National School Games Cross Country Championships.</p>
<p>VJC is extremely heartened by her endeavours and her heart for the community.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Brishen Lin, Victoria School | </strong><em><u>#whyvj</u> My #whyvj is the people that define our unique culture! They drove me and gave me the space to constantly grow daily, both in academic and non-academic areas as well as to pursue other initiatives as part of well-rounded education ðŸ˜ƒ This is how VJ has shaped me - teaching me the value of constant growth and learning to look out for and give back to those who have shaped us ðŸ¤Ÿ</em>

<br>With courage and a zest for life, Brishen chose to take up the mantle
of leadership and served the community. As a key member of the Studentsâ€™
Council, he planned various initiatives during the 2022 Mental Wellness
Week to help raise awareness about various mental health issues affecting
youths. His heart for the community was further evident in Project VJChildren,
a brainchild of his and his peers, for which they successfully raised more
than $35,000 for the Childrenâ€™s Cancer Foundation (CCF). Brishen was also
part of the Grassroots and Governance Programme for the MacPherson Single
Member Constituency, where he helped out with house visits and Meet-The-People
sessions.</p>
<p>To deepen his understanding of how the society works, Brishen served as
Head Chair at the 2023 Singapore Model Cabinet, a simulation of the Singaporean
parliamentary systemâ€™s workings, organised jointly by iGlobe and the Peopleâ€™s
Association. For his intellectual rigour and strong work ethic, Brishen
was awarded the VJC Scholarship in Appreciation of Mrs Lee Phui Mun and
