Our Victorians sat for the 2022 Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination. We are proud to announce that they have achieved an excellent set of results.

2 out of 5 students attained a University Admission Score of at least 87.5 Rank Points, which places them strongly for competitive courses in university.

1 out of 2 students achieved at least three H2 Distinctions.

We congratulate students who attained outstanding results, with 91 students obtaining the coveted perfect 90 UAS and 130 students obtaining at least 6 distinctions!

This cohort had sat for their Project Work examination in 2021, with about 9 in 10 achieving distinctions.

Congratulations to the Class of 2022! We are very proud of you and wish you the very best for your future endeavours.

A big ‘Thank You’ goes out to our teachers, parents and partners for your dedicated support of our students’ efforts.

Nil Sine Labore!
