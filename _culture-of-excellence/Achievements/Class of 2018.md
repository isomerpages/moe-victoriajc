A people-centred leader. A sensitive problem-solver. A convincing influencer. These were terms used to describe Charisse, the Vice-President of the 36th Students’ Council. In her term of office, Charisse had to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances and overcome sticky challenges. Yet, she did all of these with composure and aplomb.

Concurrently, Charisse was equally committed as a member of the VJC Choir and also managed to find time for personal development. She participated in the 2019 Criminal Behavioural Analysis Competition and volunteered her time at the Grassroots and Governance Programme.

An empathetic and respectful leader who always puts her people at the centre, Charisse is Madam Victoria who has won the hearts and minds of the college community.

*“My teachers’ willingness to share their personal experiences and their honest advice helped me tremendously in my walk as a student leader. My friends kept my morale high. This wholesome VJ experience would not be possible without such a caring and fun community.”*

Kampton is an exceptional high jumper with many accolades under his belt. During his time at VJC, he participated in the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina (7th position), 2018 ASEAN School Games in Malaysia (Gold), 2018 Hong Kong Inter-City Athletics Championship (Gold), 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines (7th position), amongst others.

At the 2019 National School Games Championship, Kampton broke the U19/U20/U23 national record with a new personal best of 2.15m. With that, he became the 2nd highest jumper in the entire sporting history of Singapore!

Kampton is truly an inspiring athlete who sets high standards for himself and strives to achieve them each time. His biggest aspiration is to compete in the Olympic Games and he has already set his sights on Paris 2024!

*“I want to thank Ms Ek who was supportive once she knew of my decision to compete at the Youth Olympic Games and the ASEAN School Games, Mrs Cindy Loh and my Project Work teammates who were so understanding, Mr Aaron Lim who took personal time out to coach me in Chemistry, Ms Evelyn Teoh who helped me arrange for extra help and make-up lessons and Mr Ho Wei Kang who helped me with Mathematics.”*
