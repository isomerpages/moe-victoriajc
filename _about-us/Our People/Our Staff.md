Here at Victoria Junior College, we have an exceptional team of educators and support staff committed to providing a nurturing and holistic education for our students. As role models for lifelong learning, our staff engage in reflective practice and devote time to continual professional development, in order to enhance their professional competencies, in both academic and non-academic areas. Beyond that, our staff believe in instilling values in our students, to ensure that student learning and development are firmly built on a strong moral foundation. Our culture of care and support also provide students with the encouragement and guidance they require, to navigate their way in a complex and challenging world and to ease their transition to adulthood.
