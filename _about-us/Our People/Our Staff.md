As role models for lifelong learning, our staff engage in reflective practice and devote time to continual professional development, in order to enhance their professional competencies, in both academic and non-academic areas. Beyond that, our staff believe in instilling values in our students, to ensure that student learning and development are firmly built on a strong moral foundation. Our culture of care and support also provide students with the encouragement and guidance they require, to navigate their way in a complex and challenging world and to ease their transition to adulthood.</p><h3>School Leaders</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023%20Images/2023%20P%20and%20VPs.jpg"></div><p>Standing from left to right:</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Principal</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Jeffrey Low<br><a href="mailto:Jeffrey_Low@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jeffrey_Low@schools.gov.sg</a></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Principal</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Grace Lee Yun Yun<br><a href="mailto:LEE_Yun_Yun_Grace@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LEE_Yun_Yun_Grace@schools.gov.sg</a></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Principal</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Koh Weining<br><a href="mailto:koh_weining@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">koh_weining@schools.gov.sg</a></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Vice-Principal (Administration)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Kyle Lim Kwee Hong<br><a href="mailto:Kyle_lim@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kyle_lim@schools.gov.sg</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
