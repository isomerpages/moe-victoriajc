**Victoria is something more**

The College vision taken from the College anthem has always seemed enigmatic. What is the ‘something more’ that VJC promises?&nbsp; What is that ‘something more’ that makes our school so special?

For me, it is camaraderie between everyone in the Victorian community that lies at the heart of our Victorian spirit. I started my journey as an educator here in VJC 30 years ago and when I left for other postings, it was the camaraderie with colleagues and students that I missed. When I returned as the College’s principal, I can again feel the fellowship and warmth of this community. During our performing arts concerts, in the sport arena, various competitions and our College events, the legendary Victorian spirit is there for all to see. **Because Victoria is Something More.**

This year, we celebrate our 40th anniversary. Our legacy and numerous achievements is the product of Victorians who’ve come through our gates. Victoria is Something More because Victorians always strived to give their best.&nbsp;

Today, we strive to continue that legacy through providing a caring and nurturing environment to support Victorians in their endeavor to be their best. We aspire to develop Victorians who are committed to all-round excellence, yet deeply anchored in values and guided by integrity. Our carefully designed total curriculum also empowers Victorians to **lead** with conviction and **serve** with empathy, so they can **excel** and become active contributors to the college and community, and social innovators for their chosen causes.&nbsp;

In VJC, you can rely on the&nbsp; efforts of our staff and the tight networks that the College has established. Our community of staff are always steadfast in their commitment to the holistic development of Victorians. They are reflective practitioners who evaluate their programmes critically and scan the landscape to keep pace with the forever changing and volatile environment. The solid and synergistic partnerships with our parents, alumni, the Victoria-Cedar Alliance partner schools, institutions of higher learning, industry players, government agencies and community organisations, amongst others, have provided plentiful opportunities for Victorians to extend their learning beyond the College. The Victoria Advisory Committee, the Old Victorians’ Association and the Parents Support Group have also provided invaluable support that made Victoria Something more.

Equally remarkable is how Victorians can always rely on one another. Victoria is Something More because **V Got your Back**. That is the theme of this year’s Open House and embodies the experience we want all Victorians to have. Everything we do, we do as a community. Any setback we encounter, we own as a community. Every victory we experience, we celebrate as a community.&nbsp;

Be part of the Victorian community, and be something more.
