<p>Welcome to Victoria Junior College! As you stepped into our college, you
may have noticed the lyrics of our Victorian Anthem proudly painted (by
Victorians!) on the walkway. Our College Vision - Victoria is Something
More: Lead, Serve, Excel - is inspired by the College anthem:</p>
<p><em>Victoria is something more,</em>
</p>
<p><em>The school that watch’d us grow.</em>

<p>Indeed, for more than 40 years, many Victorians have grown and excelled
in their chosen fields. Yet, perhaps the more important tis: what makes
VJC <em>something more?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started my journey as an educator here in VJC and when I left for other
postings, it was the camaraderie with colleagues and students that I missed.
When I returned as the College’s principal four years ago, I can again
feel the fellowship and warmth of this community. Camaraderie is in our
DNA, and I am certain that if you have stepped into VJC, you would have
felt it too.</p>
<p>During our performing arts concerts, in the sport arena, various competitions
and our College events, the legendary Victorian spirit is there for all
to see. Victorians uplift one another, and as the Principal, I can proudly
say that win or lose, V Got Your Back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your two years here, you will discover your strengths and define your
own version of “<em>Outstanding”</em>. At VJC, being outstanding is not
about fitting into a fixed mould, but about striving for excellence in
ways that are meaningful to <em>you</em>. You will also encounter new ideas,
unfamiliar situations and moments that will test you. But fret not, your
peers, teachers, family, and the wider Victorian community will cheer you
on, every step of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At VJC, you will experience the joy of learning, fuelled by curiosity,
guided by integrity, and driven by a strong sense of purpose to make a
positive impact. Through our total curriculum, we will empower you to lead
the college and the community with conviction, courage and compassion.</p>
<p>Now is your time. Step forward with confidence and make the most of every
opportunity. Be outstanding academically, in leadership, in service, and
in character. Lead, serve and excel, in your chosen fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you embark on this journey, carry forward the Victorian spirit and
let our anthem inspire you:</p>
<p><em>Victoria’s fame and our intent, to keep her flag unfurled.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Nil Sine Labore!</em>
