</p>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome to Victoria Junior College! As you stepped into our college, you
may have noticed the lyrics of our Victorian Anthem proudly painted (by
Victorians!) on the walkway. Over time, I hope these words will resonate
deeply with you and take on new significance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Victoria is something more,</em>
</p>
<p><em>The school that watch’d us grow.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The College vision taken from the College anthem has always seemed enigmatic.
You might already be asking yourself,&nbsp;What makes Victoria something
more?&nbsp;The answer lies in our spirit and community. Victoria isn’t
just a Junior College— it is a community where the camaraderie is legendary
and where Victorians uplift one another.</p>

<p>I started my journey as an educator here in VJC 30 years ago and when
I left for other postings, it was the camaraderie with colleagues and students
that I missed. When I returned as the College’s principal, I can again
feel the fellowship and warmth of this community. During our performing
arts concerts, in the sport arena, various competitions and our College
events, the legendary Victorian spirit is there for all to see.&nbsp;<strong>Because Victoria is Something More.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your two years here will be a time of growth, challenge, and discovery.
Embrace new experiences, stretch your limits, and don’t be afraid to stumble
along the way because <strong>V Got Your Back.</strong>&nbsp;This phrase,
conceptualized by the Class of 2024, reflects their experiences and hopes
for the College. Their peers, teachers, family, and the wider Victorian
community supported them every step of the way. I am certain that you will
share that experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At VJC, we are committed to helping you become the best version of yourself.
We want you to experience the joy of learning, fuelled by curiosity, guided
by integrity, and driven by a strong sense of purpose to make a positive
impact. Our total curriculum goes beyond academics, building your character
and resilience. It will empower you to actively lead the college and the
community with conviction, courage and compassion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Be bold. Be curious. Be the best version of yourself. It is your time
to lead, serve and excel, in your chosen fields. As you embark on this
journey, carry forward the Victorian spirit and let our anthem inspire
you:</p>
<p>Victoria’s fame and our intent, to keep her flag unfurled.</p>
