### Subject Combinations

VJC offers a total of 67 standard subject combinations in the Arts and Science courses.  All combinations include General Paper, Project Work and Mother Tongue at Higher 1 (H1) level.

Students should have the requisite knowledge to offer Science and Mathematics subjects at A-Level and be able to cope with the demands of the A-level curriculum. Subjects offered in the Arts course do not have any pre-requisites; however, students should consider their strengths and interests closely when choosing their subjects.

To experience a broad-based education, all students in a junior college must offer at least one contrasting subject which is outside their main area of specialisation in the Arts or Science course.

Students in VJC can offer a Foreign Language as a Higher 2 (H2) subject in any of the subject combinations.

**New!** We have added H2 Computing and H2 Chinese Language and Literature to the list of subjects on offer in 2021.

Besides these subject combinations, students with the ability and passion to deepen their learning can apply to offer a H3 subjects in the Humanities and the Science. 

There is a range of H3 offerings that are either taught by VJC teachers in college or by university lecturers at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU). VJC also offers a special H3 programme – [H3 NAV Science Research](https://victoriajc.moe.edu.sg/learn-like-a-victorian/talent-development-programme/vsmart/) – in collaboration with the Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and NUS.
