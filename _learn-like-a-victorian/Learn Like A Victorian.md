The academic programme at VJC has been shaped by our years of experience preparing students for the A-Level examinations. Just as importantly, the close support, encouragement and affirmation that Victorians get from their tutors and peers are a vital aspect of the College culture and ethos, and you can be assured you are never on this journey alone.
