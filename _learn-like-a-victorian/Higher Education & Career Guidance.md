Victoria Junior College’s comprehensive higher education, career guidance and scholarships programme is designed to assist Victorians as they explore and refine their education and career goals, so that they are able to plan their future with confidence.

The various components of the programme aim to:

*   provide up-to-date information about the evolving education and career landscape
*   help Victorians identify their interests, skills, values, as well as align these with future education and career options
*   facilitate successful applications to universities and scholarships

One major highlight on the calendar is the college’s annual EdVantage! Fair, which provides Victorians with valuable opportunities to meet industry professionals as well as university officials and students to explore a myriad of higher education, career and scholarship options. An MOE Education and Career Guidance (ECG) counsellor is also on board to provide even more personalised guidance for deeper exploration.

<p>The Higher Education programme exposes Victorians to a wide array of local and overseas education options. Institutes of higher learning visit VJC to interact with Victorians, and to update them about important changes in the tertiary education scene. For instance, students and parents can look forward to the University Panel Discussion at the end of the first academic year and interact with Victorian alumni currently studying at the universities.

VJC also hosts talks by admissions tutors from overseas universities throughout the year. Representatives from universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and others from the region visit regularly. These sessions are valuable platforms for students to consult experts about opportunities and experiences available at different institutes of higher learning</p>
