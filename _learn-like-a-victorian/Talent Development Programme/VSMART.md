Beyond the examinable H3 NUS-A\*STAR-VJC (H3-NAV) track, the college offers a comprehensive non-examinable science research programme: the Young Scientists Development (YSD) track.

**Young Scientists Development Track**

VJC has a strong research culture among the science teachers and students and has continuously supported the various research programmes of the Ministry of Education (e.g. Local and Overseas Student Attachment Programmes) and other research initiatives of the local tertiary institutions.

The college has established strong ties with local tertiary institutions (e.g. NUS, NTU and SUTD) and A\*STAR Research Institutes, allowing students to embark on scientific works that will be mentored by eminent scientists of the various fields. These works will usually be submitted to the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) and many other science fairs at national and international level.

<p>The Mentorship Attachment offers students the chance to work on research projects in Science, Medicine and Engineering under the guidance of mentors from NUS and established research centres. Students work in a real-world research environment. During the mentorship attachment in May/June, the student spends at least 2 weeks working full-time on the research project.<br>

Thereafter, the student meets with the mentor on a regular basis to complete the research work. Every student writes a scientific paper at the end of the Attachment. The papers will be published as Proceedings during the annual Research Congress to be held in Apr each year.</p>
			
<p>2.Science Research Congress</p>
			
<p>The Science Research Congress offers students an opportunity to communicate their research findings to an audience of mentors and interested JC students. On the successful completion of the Attachment, certificates of participation will be presented to the students at the Congress.</p>

<strong>NTU Nanyang Research Programme</strong>
			
<p>The Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) is an NTU outreach programme for first year Junior College students. Participants in the programme will undertake eight months of research activities, either individually or in a pair, under the charge of an NTU faculty member. This programme will culminate in the submission of a Research Paper and an Oral Presentation carried out during the NRP Oral Presentation Assessment, held in March annually.<br>

NRP offers a variety of research topics from NTU’s four Colleges – College of Engineering, College of Science, College of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences, and College of Business – as well as the National Institute of Education.</p>
			
<strong>SUTD Research Mentorship Programme</strong>
