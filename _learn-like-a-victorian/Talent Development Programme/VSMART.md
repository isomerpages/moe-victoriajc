In a special collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS) and A\*STAR, VJC offers the H3 NUS-A\*STAR-VJC (NAV) Science Research programme. Students in this unique programme can look forward to an individual Investigative Study in Physics, Chemistry or Biology under the guidance of VJC teachers and the mentorship of research practitioners from NUS and research institutes at A\*STAR. This robust programme provides ample opportunities to deepen learning and engage in the intricacies of scientific research that takes place in universities and industry.

      <p>Students in the H3 NUS-A\*STAR–VJC (NAV) programme will carry out an Investigative Study in Science under the mentorship of teachers and researchers. The programme aims to develop higher order thinking, investigative and analytical skills in students through the investigative study. It builds on the foundational knowledge and skills taught in H2 Biology, H2 Chemistry, H2 Physics and/or H2 Mathematics.</p>

<p>The programme is intended for students with high intellectual capacity and strong interests in scientific research. It allows them to extend and expand their learning on a specific area of Science, gain useful knowledge and experience which will provide the foundation for them to further engage in scientific research at a tertiary level.</p>
			
<strong>Eligibility</strong>

<p>Student is offering H2 Biology/ Chemistry/ Physics/ Mathematics (any 2)</p>

<strong>Assessment</strong>

<p>Students will undertake one science research project with the following components.</p>

<ul>
<li>Research plan and research journal</li>
<li>Research paper</li>
<li>Oral presentation</li> 
</ul>		

<p>For students who want to offer two H3, the commitment is spread out over the two years</p>

Beyond the examinable H3 NUS-A\*STAR-VJC (H3-NAV) track, the college offers a comprehensive non-examinable science research programme: the Young Scientists Development (YSD) track.

**Young Scientists Development Track**

VJC has a strong research culture among the science teachers and students and has continuously supported the various research programmes of the Ministry of Education (e.g. Local and Overseas Student Attachment Programmes) and other research initiatives of the local tertiary institutions.

The college has established strong ties with local tertiary institutions (e.g. NUS, NTU and SUTD) and A\*STAR Research Institutes, allowing students to embark on scientific works that will be mentored by eminent scientists of the various fields. These works will usually be submitted to the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) and many other science fairs at national and international level.

      <p>There is a range of projects offered under the YSD track in collaboration with external research institutes and local universities. These include:</p>

<strong>NUS Science Research Programme</strong>

<p>The NUS Science Research Programme is offered in collaboration with NUS and the Gifted Education Branch of the Ministry of Education. It aims to enable very capable students who aspire to a higher level of challenge to undertake projects under the supervision of academics and scientists in a real research environment. This programme comprises 2 parts:</p>

<p>1.Mentorship Attachment</p>
			
<p>The Mentorship Attachment offers students the chance to work on research projects in Science, Medicine and Engineering under the guidance of mentors from NUS and established research centres. Students work in a real-world research environment. During the mentorship attachment in May/June, the student spends at least 2 weeks working full-time on the research project.<br>

Thereafter, the student meets with the mentor on a regular basis to complete the research work. Every student writes a scientific paper at the end of the Attachment. The papers will be published as Proceedings during the annual Research Congress to be held in Apr each year.</p>
			
<p>2.Science Research Congress</p>
			
<p>The Science Research Congress offers students an opportunity to communicate their research findings to an audience of mentors and interested JC students. On the successful completion of the Attachment, certificates of participation will be presented to the students at the Congress.</p>

<strong>NTU Nanyang Research Programme</strong>
			
<p>The Nanyang Research Programme (NRP) is an NTU outreach programme for first year Junior College students. Participants in the programme will undertake eight months of research activities, either individually or in a pair, under the charge of an NTU faculty member. This programme will culminate in the submission of a Research Paper and an Oral Presentation carried out during the NRP Oral Presentation Assessment, held in March annually.<br>

NRP offers a variety of research topics from NTU’s four Colleges – College of Engineering, College of Science, College of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences, and College of Business – as well as the National Institute of Education.</p>
			
<strong>SUTD Research Mentorship Programme</strong>
			
<p>SUTD offers research project opportunities and provides mentorship to selected pre-university students every year under this programme. Beyond giving the participants some experiential learning opportunities in research, SUTD offers participants special consideration for admissions and scholarships, should they apply to SUTD subsequently.</p>
			
<strong>Research @YDSP</strong>

<p>Defence Science Organisation (DSO) and Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) offer the Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP) that will stimulate and spur student's interest in science and technology. Under the mentorship of DSO's scientists and engineers, students will gain insightful research experience as they work on interesting defence related projects in a real laboratory environment.</p>

At VJC, we constantly seek learning opportunities for students to pursue their interests in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Students can sign up for a variety of STEM-related activities including competitions and events offered by MOE, statutory boards and institutions of higher learning.  We strongly believe that participation in such activities would be helpful in broadening the knowledge of students in STEM and allow them to learn new skills.

The enrichment activities include:

*   Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics & Informatics Olympiads
*   Science & Mathematics competitions such as International Biomedical Quiz, Graphic calculator design competition, Australian Mathematics competition
*   Science conventions such as International Science Youth Forum
*   Science Centre events such as Singapore Science Festival
*   Learning journeys such as visits to NUS Physics demonstration lab, local food and agriculture industries
*   Science camps such as STEP-NUS Sunburst BrainCamp
*   Science shows & talks by scientists

As the East Zone Centre of Excellence in Science & Technology, VJC organises workshops, seminars and competitions for primary, secondary and pre-university students, attracting more than 1100 participants yearly from 50 schools nationwide.

These sessions not only provide enrichment opportunities for the participating schools, they are also a platform for Victorians to plan, lead and run activities for other students, thus spreading their passion and interest in science and technology.

This year the centre once again is organising the annual STEM Festival@VJC to encourage students from schools to be actively engaged in the learning and applications of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) through a series of activities and events. This is part of the Centre’s efforts to inspire and foster greater interest amongst participants in STEM and our participants can develop a better appreciation of the connections and impact of STEM on their life, environment and society.

The centre is proud to partner with various organisations (DSTA-DSO, A\*STAR and SUTD) and present the following STEM-related competitions for the schools to participate.

All the competitions will take place virtually.
