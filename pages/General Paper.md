Be prepared to get involved in debates and discussions, thrashing out issues with your peers and your tutor, defining your own world view as well as learning about issues and ideas you have never considered before.&nbsp; In a nutshell, GP is all about viewpoints: yours and others. It will probably be the most important subject you will ever take in your life, and the springboard to becoming a mature and discerning adult.</p>
