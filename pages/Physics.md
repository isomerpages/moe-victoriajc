Dive into the realm of Physics and discover the hidden mysteries behind motion, energy, and the cosmos!</p><p>We aim to cater to students with different learning styles. To enthuse students about the wonders of physics, we occasionally bring toys such as the quadcopter drone into the classroom to illustrate concepts of dynamics. For the kinesthetic learner, we conduct enrichment activities, such as on kinematics showing the vertical motion of a bouncing ball using a data logger. Using POE methodology, we get students to <strong>P</strong>redict, <strong>O</strong>bserve and then <strong>E</strong>xplain the observations. We also try to get the logical and interpersonal learners to work together in small groups to solve certain problems, such as on parabolic or projectile motion of objects. To stretch students’ understanding of physics concepts, we routinely employ Socratic questioning techniques involving extension questions so that students learn concepts in depth. We use ICTplatforms such as the Students’ Learning Space (SLS) and other tools such as Kahoot, Mentimeter,Google Forms, etc to augment the classroom teaching experience.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023 Acad Subj Pages/students_doing_a_bouncing_ball_activity_using_a_datalogger.jpg"></div><p></p>
