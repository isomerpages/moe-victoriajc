<p>Have you thought about continuing to be active learners and proficient users in Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language? In our MTL classrooms, students will be given varied opportunities through our curriculum and programme to cultivate the love for the languages and be proficient users of the languages in real life contexts.<br></p><p>As the famous psycholinguist Frank Smith says,&nbsp; <em>"One language sets you in a corridor for life. Two languages open every door along the way.‚Äù </em>Learning MTLs well can open doors to better communication, deeper understanding of cultural wealth and stronger connection with the global communities that speak similar languages.</p>
