Lewis says<em> “Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides; and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become.” </em>Enjoy the language and literary works in class and enrich your MTL learning.</p>
