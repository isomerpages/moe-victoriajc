<p>The Class of 2025 has completed the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination,
and we are proud to celebrate their outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>Over two years, the Victorians of the Class of 2025 excelled across academics,
CCAs, service and leadership. They met challenges head-on, persevered through
demanding seasons, and continued to show up for one another.</p>
<p>Class of 2025, you completed your final lap in VJC with grit and grace,
and we are proud not only of what you have accomplished, but of the people
you have become.</p>
<p>Our deepest appreciation to our teachers, parents, and partners for your
steadfast support in nurturing, guiding, and journeying alongside our students. <em>Nil Sine Labore!</em>
