<p>Feeling bored doing pages and pages of routine practice? Or uncertain about what to expect in H2/ H1 Mathematics since it is a compulsory subject to take?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>At VJC, we hope to help you explore the beauty of Math by teaching towards Big Ideas, and guiding you through meaningful Learning Experiences to discover mathematical results on your own. You are expected to be disciplined and self-directed in your learning - lectures are hosted on the Student Learning Space (SLS) and you will have to be diligent in completing the lectures, online quizzes, tutorials and written assignments in your own time. In the classroom, our Mathematics teachers are proficient in using a range of pedagogical and ICT tools (Kami, OneNote, iPad etc) to support you in your learning, and are always ready to meet you for consultations if you need help.&nbsp; You will be using the graphing calculator as part of the examination requirements, and will be exposed to questions with context and real-life applications.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Be ready to come onboard the learning of Mathematics at VJC with an open and disciplined mind!</p><p></p>
