<p>The Victorian SEAL is our commitment that every Victorian is holistically
developed, grounded in strong core values and ready for the challenges
of the future. It is a frame that places our College Values and the Emerging
21st Century Competencies at the centre of the Victorian experience.</p>
<p>These values and competencies are demonstrated, discerned, and developed
via the four SEAL domains. All Victorians will benefit from a strong academic
programme, and will be given opportunities to lead, serve, and excel in
the classroom, their CCAs, and ad-hoc opportunities.</p>
<p>Through it all, Victorians will be guided by the Victorian Village; a
community of teachers to provide feedback and coaching to each student,
with peers to encourage and cheer them on too. #vgotyourback</p>
<p>Through SEAL, every Victorian is empowered to choose their own “Outstanding”
- defining what excellence means to them and growing into their fullest
potential. They graduate with the Victorian SEAL, as Victorians who are
not just ready for the world, but ready to shape it.&nbsp;</p>
