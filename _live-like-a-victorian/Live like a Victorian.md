### Living like a Victorian

Life in VJC is more than just grades and accolades. It’s about becoming part of a bigger family, working hard and playing harder. We exult in one another’s triumphs, comfort one another in times of uncertainty, and cheer like mad for one another’s achievements. 

All year round, the college sizzles with activities. We’re a college that stretches our students’ potential, yet allow them to have fun along the way. In particular, we challenge students to dig deep and get their hands dirty engaging with real-world issues, both locally and overseas.

Who’s got spirit? We have.
