VJC also offers students the opportunity to start their own Student Interest Groups (SIGs). Created by Victorians, for Victorians, SIGs bring together like-minded Victorians to network, explore and deepen their interests and work towards a common cause. 

Past SIGs initiated by our Victorians included VGastronomy, Pets and Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), Beanie Bros, Korean Club and more! VGastronomy reviews makan places and shares what's good in the hood, PAWS looks out for our furry friends, Beanie Bros not only levels up their crocheting skills, but also brings a cheer to cancer patients with their lovingly-crocheted beanies and Korean Club promotes a greater appreciation for the Korean culture.
