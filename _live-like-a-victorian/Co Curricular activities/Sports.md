Yo VJC! What’s up? The ever –familiar cheer is heard loud and clear during sports season at VJC.

If Performing Arts is the heart of VJC, then Sports is its soul. One of the most exciting times of any given year falls during sports season. Many of our teams have a legacy of victory, ensuring that Victorians carry it on game after game, season after season. Always fired-up, Victorians play with passion and pride that comes naturally to them. In a similar vein, the rest of the college turns up behind them in full force supporting them with all their might. 

Our dedicated teachers and trainers provide Victorians with the opportunity to build skills such as good character, strong leadership and teamwork. Through each sport, Victorians develop a championship mentality and the skills to match.

VJC has a range of facilities for our sportsmen and women to develop their athletic talent. Beyond the full-length synthetic field, 9-lane track, mini-hockey field and tennis courts, Victorians have access to an air-conditioned hall and a sheltered court. Across the road, East Coast Parkway provides an ideal venue for Cross-Country, Sailing, outdoor camp craft, Orientation activities, and general relaxation!
