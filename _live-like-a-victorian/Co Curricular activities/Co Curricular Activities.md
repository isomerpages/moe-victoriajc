Being Victorian is about becoming part of a bigger fraternity and a broader shared experience. Co-curricular activities (CCAs) are integral to a balanced and holistic learning experience. Here in VJC, we provide students with exciting opportunities for character building and nurture life skills and attributes such as leadership, teamwork and empathy. At the same time, students can pursue their interests and pick up specific skills, forge strong bonds and of course have a great deal of fun!

Categories of CCAs that we offer:

### Club and Societies 

Whether to deepen a passion or find a new hobby there is definitely a club that suits your fancy. With many an award-winner amongst its members, our clubs and societies provide Victorians with myriad ways and means to extend their knowledge on global issues, the latest technological trends or medical breakthroughs.


### Performing Arts

At its heart, our performing arts CCAs offer Victorians an avenue to express themselves and stage their talents in various concerts and events throughout the year. VJCâ€™s talent is rich and diverse with Victorians performing on internationally-renowned stages both locally and overseas.
