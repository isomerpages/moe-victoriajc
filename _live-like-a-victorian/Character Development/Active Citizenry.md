The Active Citizenry programme in VJC aims to develop in our students an understanding of what it means to be a Singaporean and a global citizen. This objective is achieved through both the National Education programme and Values-in-Action (VIA) projects. Through a framework of 'Expose, Inspire and Lead', experiences are designed in a manner to enable students to progressively deepen their involvement as active citizens in their communities. Together with other co-curricular programmes, these experiences complement the development of 21st century competencies needed for Victorians to be future-ready citizens.
