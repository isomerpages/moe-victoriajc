VJC was honoured to have Dr Beh Swan Gin, Chairman of the Singapore Economic Development Board, visit our college for a dialogue with staff. Dr Beh provided interesting insights on how Singapore responds to rapidly emerging economic challenges and opportunities. A lively discussion took place on various issues, including the importance of remaining receptive to the world around us, in order for Singapore to stay competitive and resilient in a VUCA world.
