On 6 Jul, VJC had the honour of hosting the Belgian ambassador to Singapore, Her Excellency Ms Colette Taquet, and Deputy Head of Mission and Consul, Mr Christophe Lechat, as part of the ‘EU Comes to Your School’ Programme. During the sharing session, our JC1 cohort learnt more about Belgium and the EU, deepening an appreciation for the geopolitical realities and cultural complexities of our VUCA world.
