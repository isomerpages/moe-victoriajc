Victorians ended the year with a bang! It was a full day of fun as we headed to Sentosa for games, while also clocking steps for Southeast CDC X Fair Price Foundation Walk for Rice. The College raised nearly 45 000 bowls of rice for less privileged families. We ended the day with a slew of performances by students, staff and alumni at VivoCity Amphitheatre, our spirit and cheer definitely brought the house down. Kudos to the Victorian Affair adhoc who planned the event amidst other academic and co-curricular activities.
