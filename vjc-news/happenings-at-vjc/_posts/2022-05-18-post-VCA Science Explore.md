On 18th May, IP1 students and their teachers from Victoria School and Cedar Girls Secondary School participated in the 2022 Victoria-Cedar Alliance (VCA) Science Explore. After a two year break due to COVID-19, it was heartening to see young Victorians and Cedarians enjoy the STEM related hands-on activities and experiments. They were fully engaged all afternoon in problem solving and exploration. Not only did they get to explore various aspects of science and technology in the activities, students from both schools were able to socialise and interact with each other and their seniors from Victoria JC. The seniors had a blast designing and facilitating the workshops, and it was a joy to see the VCA fraternity enjoying the activities!
