Mr Ong visited VJC for a dialogue session with the JC1s where he shared insights and perspectives about global developments, and provided us with deeper understanding of our nation’s foreign policy principles. The dialogue also saw our students quizzing him on his ambassadorial experience and how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs navigates bilateral, regional and international relations.
