Victorians ushered in The Year of the Tiger with gusto and style! Art Club decked our campus in festive colours in the lead up to the big day. On 27 & 28 Jan 2022, the Chinese Society set up activity booths at the concourse to teach Victorians how to write auspicious couplets and craft adorable hairbands. Interact Club and Project Victus (a VJ Cares initiative) also organised a Food Drive to collect food donations for the beneficiaries of Food Bank Singapore. On 31 Jan, Victorians were treated to a spectacular showcase of talent by Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Dance Club, Indian Cultural Society, Malay Cultural Society and Wushu! It was a roaring start to a wonderful new year!
