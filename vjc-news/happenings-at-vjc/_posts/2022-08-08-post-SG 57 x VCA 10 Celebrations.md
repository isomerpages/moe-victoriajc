For our SG 57 X VCA 10 celebrations this year, Victorians embarked on a campaign involving ten ways to create a sustainable Singapore. The projects included beach clean-up activities, food and clothes collection drives and upcycling workshops. On 8 Aug, the Victoria-Cedar Alliance schools came together to commemorate ten awesome years of collaboration. The strong camaraderie was on full display, as we renewed our pledge to build an inclusive, compassionate and sustainable society. Stronger Together, Majulah!
