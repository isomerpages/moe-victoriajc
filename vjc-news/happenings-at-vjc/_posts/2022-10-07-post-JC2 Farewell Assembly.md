We sent off our JC2s with some fun and games under the sun, followed by a combined assembly. It was a walk down memory late as we reminisced about “LaBear and the Legend of the Ten Things.” We are heartened that our JC2s have been resilient and committed in overcoming the challenges that have come their way, all while staying true to the pursuit of excellence. We are thrilled to see what they will achieve in the coming years, as they keep our flag unfurled.
