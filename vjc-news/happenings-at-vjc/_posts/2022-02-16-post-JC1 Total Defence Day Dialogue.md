Each year, VJC commemorates Total Defence Day through student engagement dialogues. On 16 Feb 2022, we were honoured to have our alumnus BG Tan Tiong Keat, commander of 2nd People’s Defence Force, share with our JC1 cohort his insights about the geopolitical aspects of defence that is relevant to Singapore as a small city state, as well as speak about the role of our military in protecting Singapore’s air and sea space. To the brave men and women of the SAF, VJC salutes you!
