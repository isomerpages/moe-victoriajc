Amidst the hustle and bustle of Term 3, the college held VCares, our first ever Mental Wellness Awareness Week. Victorians tried their hand at a range of self-care activities and practised mindfulness breathing exercises. School counsellor Ms Sangeetha and clinical psychologist Dr Amanda Oh also shared with us useful tips on managing stress and anxiety. VJC strives to be a caring and compassionate community, where support and help are available to all Victorians.
