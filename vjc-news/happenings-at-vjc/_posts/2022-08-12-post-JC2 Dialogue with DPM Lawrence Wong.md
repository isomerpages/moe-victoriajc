VJC was excited and honoured to welcome back our distinguished alumnus, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Mr Lawrence Wong, on 12 Aug. During the dialogue, DPM Wong hared the economic and political vision of the government, in light of the internal and external challenges facing Singapore. The JC2 students were incredibly engaged and the Q&A session was reflective of the issues our youths felt passionately about. The session reminded Victorians to remain resilient and steadfast, and inspired us to be the best versions of ourselves, in order to bring our nation forward.
