On 11 Feb 2022, VJC welcomed back our distinguished alumna, Ms Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for the Ministry of Education & Ministry of Manpower, for the JC2 Total Defence Day Dialogue. MOS Gan shared with Victorians her insights about how international developments can affect Singapore, and spoke about how keeping our economy resilient and improving employability of the local workforce can contribute to Total Defence. The session was enlightening and MOS Gan inspired us with how she made personal breakthroughs and defied expectations in the course of her illustrious career. She truly exemplified our college motto: Nil Sine Labore.
