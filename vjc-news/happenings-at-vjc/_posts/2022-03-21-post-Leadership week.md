Term 2 started off with a bang with Leadership Week! Our very own student leaders shared how they #makeithappen in various ways. From leading their peers in class, to college-wide initiatives, and serving the larger community. There are indeed various platforms and opportunities for our students to hone their leadership and create a vibrant and caring community.
