Our JC2 CCA leaders have played a key role in inspiring and galvanising their peers in various competitions and initiatives. Since Term 2, they have also been preparing to pass the baton over to their juniors. The handover was made official during the Student Leaders’ Investiture on 19 Aug, where the JC1 CCA Leaders took their pledge to serve the college and bring glory to VJC. We look forward to them building on the good work and legacy of the seniors. Nil Sine Labore!
