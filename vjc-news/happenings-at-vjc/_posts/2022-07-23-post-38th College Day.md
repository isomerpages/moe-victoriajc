On 23 Jul, VJC celebrated our 38th College Day. After two long pandemic years, the Victorian family gathered to celebrate the triumphs of our very own and to express gratitude to those who came before us. Guest-of-Honour, Prof Teo Yik Ying, Dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, also visited the VJC Science & Technology Centre to launch its new logo.
