In conjunction with Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight, Victorians were treated to a spectacular array of exhibitions and activities. MTL Fortnight was kickstarted by a live performance by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) and the next day, the concourse was abuzz with Victorians trying their hands (and feet) at traditional games and crafts.
