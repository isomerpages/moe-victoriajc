With the easing of COVID-19 SMM, the National School Games, the largest annual inter-school sports competition, was back! And true to the Victorian Spirit, our athletes made us proud with their high standards in sportsmanship, discipline and skills. And on the stands, our school spirit was clearly seen and heard. Led by the Red Shirts, our Victorians cheered on their peers, and continued even during the breaks, bringing a carnival-like atmosphere to the Games. Their excellent performance netted the College 4 Champion, 8 Runner-Up and 5 Second Runner-Up place trophies. Well-done Victorians!
