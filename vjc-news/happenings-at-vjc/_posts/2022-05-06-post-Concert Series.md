Live concerts are back in season this year at Victoria JC! We had a grand total of 5 concerts, kickstarted by the very popular MusicFest (The Comeback), followed by A Night to Remember (Dance Club, Indian Cultural Society & Drama Club), Renascence (String Ensemble, Piano Ensemble & Harmonica Band), Revenite (Guitar Ensemble & Symphonic Band) and Coalescence (Chinese Orchestra & Choir). Victorians of various musical backgrounds (some new to the instruments!) practiced their hearts out to celebrate and revel in the joy of music.
