We are heartened that our Executive and Administration staff members were awarded the MSEA which recognises MOE staff who are passionate in their service delivery, consistently serve internal and external customers with C.A.R.E (Courtesy, Accessibility, Responsiveness and Effectiveness). Beyond providing exceptional service, these recipients also inspire their colleagues to do likewise. Ms Habsah Binte Aripin was awarded the Silver Award, while Mdm Koh Seow Chin and Mdm Massumarni Bte Awi. Our Operation Manager, Mr Teo Hung Meng, was awarded both the Gold and Platinum Award!
