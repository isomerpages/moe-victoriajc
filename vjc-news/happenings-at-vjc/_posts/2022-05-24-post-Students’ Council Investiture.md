Students’ Council (SC) Investiture was held on the last Monday of Term 2 and witnessed the stepping down of the 38th SC and handing over to the 39th SC. It was a significant event to remember the key contributions of the 38th SC who worked tirelessly to ensure that their peers are still able to experience a full college life, despite the restrictions due to the pandemic. As we thank the 38th, we also look forward to exciting initiatives that the 39th will bring. Nil Sine Labore!
