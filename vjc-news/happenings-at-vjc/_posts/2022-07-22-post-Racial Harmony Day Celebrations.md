This year’s Racial Harmony Day theme ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’ was exemplified in a week-long line-up of activities to celebrate our nation’s unique social fabric. Civics lessons stimulated meaningful conversations about the respect for diversity, while the showcase by our cultural societies helped Victorians understand the intricacies of various ethnic communities’ wedding rituals. Students and staff came decked in colourful ethnic wear, whilst engaging in traditional games and sampling cuisine of different racial groups.
